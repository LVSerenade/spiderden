I didn't go out of my way to get Samsung B-die memory, but I picked up the most affordable color-matching 3200 MHz kit that was on the motherboard QVL, and it ended up being B-die. Great looking. VERY tight timings. I was easily able to reach the rated speed of 3200 MHz by enabling the XMP profile, with both the first-gen Ryzen 5 1600 and the Ryzen 3 2200G. I could probably overclock it to a higher frequency or tune the timings even tighter, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort when I'm already at 3200 and CL14. Expensive, but totally worth it, especially since first-gen Ryzen loves fast memory."

Nothing more to say.,Fast 2666 16GB RAM for quite cheap from a nice brand with good asthetics.,Great RAM, although my motherboard didn't detect correct speed, it was really easy to get it to proper speed.,I got this RAM cheap for about Â£80 so it was a great deal. High speed, works fine, looks good and a reputable manafacturer - what more can I say?,A little expensive but that is to be expected with the current cryptocraze going on. It runs without issue at advertised speeds and looks very nice. They doing feel as flimsy as some of the cheaper ran sticks I have used in the past.,Does its job well ,After looking around for ram that was compatible with my mobo, I ended up getting these bad boys. These are super fast and I used the XMP to get to 2666 and I am more than pleased with the speed. Paid: $174.95,No complaints. Good RAM. Fast. Does the job. Bang for buck.,These are the greatest memory sticks that money can buy. I'm a fan for life.,I almost couldn't afford a 2x8 kit, but these came on sale the week of Black Friday on Newegg so I jumped at them. I did need to adjust my RAM speed in the UEFI since the default had it reading 2133, but that was easy enough."

This is the second time i'm buying a pair of these because they're very reliable and look nice in most builds. This set goes at 3000 MHz and to be honest you wouldn't see much of a performance difference in mainstream uses. It feels great in the hand, looks great on paper, and is great in performance, what more to ask for?,Had trouble getting this memory to overclock very well. Wasn't able to get anywhere near 3000Mhz at any voltages. Best I was able to get was 2666 but admittedly I'm an amateur/novice overclocker. I'm sure I haven't done something right. Only saving grace is that I was able to get it for a good discount ($125 in Nov. of 2017 when average 16gb kits are around $150). ,Bought this kit because of great reviews and a decent price compared to others. With Ryzen the motherboard wont read the memory at what it should run at, mine is at 2133mhz even with the most current BIOS. Will update if I can OC and get it to 3000 or higher.,Update- Upgraded bios 3.0 and was able to ram speed to 2933mhz with no issues.,Clocked up to 3000 as advertised on XMP,Got this in a combo with the SSD from Newegg for $229. This may not be the fastest or coolest looking RAM out there, but I couldn't argue with the price (I may disagree in a few months if RAM prices come down). I was able to get it to run at 3000MHz very easily with a profile in the BIOS, so I'm quite pleased overall.,Good RAM, no issues both sticks pass memtest. Hear good things about RMAing with G.Skill.,The ram works as advertised after a Bios update. The heat spreader has a cheaper stamped and bent metal feel, but nice nonetheless.,I feel that with current memory compatibility concerns with certain CPU's, manufacturers should update their product pages to ascertain which memory module manufacturer was used, which leads to a reduction in rating.,Solid ram for my setup. Its working well with my ryzen 5 1600.,It does the job, looks nice, etc. Going from 2gb to 16gb of RAM was really an improvement. I have yet to use any more than 70% of RAM on any set of tasks I have set upon this rig.,Great for the price!"

It's perfect.,Got these low-profile because I thought I'd need the space. Turns out I didn't but... RAM is RAM, nothing really to see here.,Bought these on sale for $159.99 on NewEgg right before most 16GB DDR4 RAM sticks went above the $200.00. Originally, I wanted the black sticks, but they were sold out very quickly. These work great. They initially hovered around 2100 in the BIOS before I sped them up to 2933. So far so good."

The low profile nature of this RAM is great for large CPU coolers, and the non-hassle packaging is also a bonus!,Priced fairly (at least compared to similar ram), and performance well. Used the xmp profile on an x470 board, and all is good. Easy, trouble free, no complaints here. ,It works. One thing tho, this RAM got 16-20-20-38 timings which is not usual for CL16 RAM (I got Hynix C-die chips), I recommend slightly dropping timings to 16-18-18-36, I gained about 5.5 FPS in Arma 3 by doing that, will tune it further when I will have the free time.,Good looking and affordable. Performs like expected,Looks very clean.,I'd initially planned a white case and got this to match. Still looks good (I think) and it does the job. No problems getting it to run at 3000 though it's not one of the BIOS XMP profiles. Also this specific kit doesn't appear in the MSi QVL for the mobo but it does play nicely.,Looks good and is cheaper than other white ram such as G.Skill Trident Z.

Also, for you AMD Ryzen builders out there, I had zero issues getting this RAM to run at the advertised frequency, even a little above, and CAS despite not being on my motherboardâs approved list of RAM. These are also made specifically for Intel I believe, but like I said, not issues what so ever.,Bought two of these kits for 64GB total. 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 Samsung B-Die goodness.

I got the faster 14 timing. I'm not sure it would really matter, but I had the budget, and I figured it would probably give me a little flexibility should I do any overclocking. One annoying quirk, the LEDs go back into 'unicorn vomit' mode if I boot from a full shutdown. Also, the LEDs can only be addressed in Windows, which is a bit of a PITA for me, as I'm mostly in MacOS. Would RAM again.,G.Skill never disappoints. Memory came clocked at 3200 MHz as advertised. Just made some changes to the BIOS settings to allow it to use its full clock speed and it was off to the races. Planning on getting two more 16 GB sticks in the future. I'll have a server for a PC.,RAM was one of the most difficult components to choose: at the beginning all I knew was that I wanted a 2x16GB configuration but due to the many variants of modules offered by each manufacturer I really had no idea about how I could determine for sure whether one product was really better than another considering both frequencies and latencies.,After some research I found a very simple but - I guess - useful ratio that really helped me to easily find the real RAM speed for each variant, considering both its frequency and CAS: thanks to this simple frequency/CAS ratio I found a certain value (3200/14 = 228,57) for these 3200MHz modules with extremely low 14-14-14-34 latencies - by far the lowest I could find on the market - that could be overcome only by 4000MHz with CAS 17 (235,29 ratio) or 4133MHz with CAS 17 (243,12 ratio), in both cases costing much more due to their extreme frequencies (and also granting less MB compatibility).,Taking the example of a 3600MHz memory with CAS 17 (i.e. GSkill F4-3600C17D-32GTZR), I would get an inferior 211,76 frequency/CAS ratio, also paying more than I did due to its superior frequencies.,Does all this make any sense? I really don't know but I like to think it does.,No issues whatsoever. The RGB software is intuitive, if not a little clunky. It is easy to match colors with Razer's Chroma and NZXT's CAM software.,G.skill Trident: Thoughts I am happy as frak that this pair worked for OC this kit at time of purchase was not on the qmp list from either company so overclocking was a cross your fingers and hope for the best. Thankfully G.skill and Asus once again game in and delivered a product combo that just works and that all we want right?,This stuff does not come cheap but after tons of research I decided to go with the CAS14 @ 3200 as apparently the 2700x prefers this stuff.
Whether or not it is possible to tell the difference between CAS14 and Cas16 timings is up to the experts. 
To look at it's amazing. The RGB is very effective and totally controllable using MSI Mystic Light. I only have the 2 sticks which I thought might look weird but actually it looks amazing. "

I have run it on most all of the stilts default safe and fast settings from 3466 to 3200.  Have not stability tested them yet.  They run and make it thru games and benchmarks.  The higher settings do return higher benchmark scores.  If prices came down another 30% would look at higher speed rated sticks; these seem a good value at current prices.,As mentioned above I was going to have it price matched to $99 but they matched the mobo instead so I payed $139.99 for this ram but considering it's Samsung B-Die I can't really complain. I haven't done much testing or messed with the overclocking yet except I have tried to run the XMP to 3200 and it failed to boot with crash loops but I think the issue it I put the ram in A1,B1 and instead I should have used A2,B2 for 2 stick according to the motherboard manual. I'll do this soon and try out xmp and maybe some mild overclocking on it since it's B-Die and report back, only reason I haven't done it yet is I may have to take out the GIANT heatsink to switch the memory (see above noctua review)."

4 sticks usage is a bit complicated but still good. Fast preset works for rated speed - 3200 @ 14-14-14-28 (vs 14-14-14-31 from XMP) and 3466 @ 14-15-14-28.

Still fast as hell though, and LEDS :),Good sturdy Ram stick. I have not really tested much of the performance yet but the quality is much better than any other stick I have used. I feel like I could drop these out of a 3rd story window and they would still work. Corsair also offers tons of customization on these: LED fan cooling unit, LED conversion kit.,Running 4x8GB of these is most definitely overkill for current gaming demands, but what was I supposed to do... leave 2 DIMM slots empty!! High class, heavy duty RAM that runs at 3200Mhz out the box when paired with the 3600X.,
Just got this on sale for cheaper than what I bought the 2666mhz RGB Vengeance for. The silver on the Dominator memory goes perfectly with this build, so RGB isn't an issue.

That game is cpu heavy and the base game alone eats up 8gb of ram.. in order to fully enjoy the workshop contents, i needed to have more ram to futureproof myself from future game updates(they add more assets into the game per update).. At least i now know im futureproofing myself with 48gb of ram.. I chose red as it definitely fit my gpu color, so that inside of my rig wouldn't be a collection of random colors lol.. I definitely would love to upgrade in the future for a ram with rgb lighting.. Not the fastest at 2400mhz, because when I built my rig, I was trying to cut corners on some price, and I thought I can sacrifice the ram speed.. I definitely would love to upgrade one day for a 3k mhz ram.. Price at the time i bought my 16gigs was still good before the mining craze jacked up the ram stick price up.. The 32gigs i bought was probably expensive due to mining craze, but cities skylines made me swallow the steep price to get more ram.. Nowadays in 2019 with mining craze fading away, ram prices are going down, but not as good as pre-mining craze..,Good quality RAM that's compatible with a variety of boards.

So this is a cheap option for B-Die and good RAM for Ryzen. Currently running stable at 3000 on my Ryzen 5 2600 build. Asus Aura has no issue controlling the RGB. ,to use Aura sync, first download the patriot software and turn off the lights, uninstall that and then install the Aura software specifically for Patriot! not the Aura software found in the support section of your MOBO. Enjoi,So a little about myself, I research things...a lot, probably too much. So when the task of choosing RAM came about I started my journey on researching the best RAM to run with a AMD 450 chip set mobo. Thereâs everyoneâs go-to: Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB, Gskill Trident RGB which people have run without issue with AMD but a lot of people have also experienced problems with those popular choices with AMD chipsets, so I dove a little deeper. The main issues it seems stemmed from the 350 chipset, not the 450 which I ended up running (Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming) but I still didnât want to chance it. I came across Team Tforce RAM which many AMD users had a lot of success with, I thought I had found the one. But of course I didnt stop scouring the internets, reading reviews and blogs and combing through countless QVLs. I then came across Patriot Viper RGB RAM. Read every review I could find on Newegg or Amazon. 99% were great with most people getting the advertised 3000mhz or 3200mhz with AMD chip sets. But then I dove a little deeper and looked at some blogs. Not only were people getting the advertised clock speeds but every review I read people successfully overclocked them easily getting 4000+mhz while keeping their system stable. So at the end of what seemed like preparing to write a thesis on what RAM is best for AMD chip sets and overclocking stability I decided to go with the Patriot Viper RGB 3200mhz 16gb kit. I havenât had to time to spend to overclock it but I am getting the advertised 3200mhz right off the bat and I don't think I will have an issue pushing it further.,Clocked at 3200 with no issues.,Fast stable love the color ratation"

I havent messed around with it too much yet, but with XMP enabled, i have set it at 2666mhz and it is flawless.,Corsair is always a good choice. I was looking into G.Skillz RAM to pair with my Ryzen, but the Asus mobo didn't have any above 16GB that were verified and/or rated well. I fell back on Corsair  (a guaranteed brand) and couldn't be happier! ,Be careful to check the throttle on your Motherboard, as I had to do some tinkering with voltages to get above the stock 2133. Currently, 2666 is running smooth. I will look into getting closer to that bench of 3000 with more troubleshooting in the future. ,The real deal. Just as I imagined they'd be - build construction and quality is so solid. They feel great, look great and perform great. Simply applied the XMP profile and might try overclocking after a few weeks. Opted to stick with two sticks for single Dual Channel performance; no regrets there.,A little pricey, but they are aesthetically pleasing and that is half the battle. ,Cheapest 2x16GB RAMs on Amazon I could find with a one-day shipping.

Although the aesthetics have no baring on performance and in this build, will most likely be never seen, for the photos included = badass, aha.  ,If you're looking for high capacity fast RAM, this is a very nice option. I can't imagine there's a ton of people that NEED or really care that much about the speed and CAS latency, but, for those of us who do - I wasn't disappointed. It also has very faint white LEDs under the heat spreaders. Just enough to accent - not enough to draw attention."

Wouldn't have bought this if it wasn't on sale but for almost the same (inflated) price of normal RAM I thought I might as well.

Looks great especially in white and syncs nicely with I cue software to match all the the other Corsair products. Highly recommend!,Can't review the speed or latency beacause i can't see difference between two similar rams, i have 24Go of 2400MHz( on xmp2.0) c16 and its work very well.
But RGB is reaaaly impressive, you can do every effect you want and light effect look really good, Great heat speader too.,Reliable RAM, overclocked to 3600 MHz,Only complaint is that the RGBs can only be controlled with iCUE."

None of the RAM kits currently available in 2x16GB configurations hit my previous CAS/size requirements, so I stuck with 2x8GB for now. Oddly, UEFI/BIOS recognize this RAM's bandwidth at 2133MHz, and the decorative sticker that came on the RAM is pretty low quality stuff.,The stickers on the sticks look rather cheap in my opinion.,works perfect at rated speed. I do, however, think it's pretty lame to have stickers on the sides printed to look like heat shields.

No issue overclocking to 2400 using the included XMP profile.,A bit expensive at local market., As Low Profile as DDR4 can get. These have no heat spreaders, just a black and red sticker covering up the sides. Dropped it in an ASRock Z370 Mini ITX Board and it took off and ran just fine.

As far as the RGB feature, you will not find anything better.  The colors are bright and very fluid.  Knocked a star off only because of the price.  If you do not care about the RGB aspect of RAM, you can get some very affordable high performance RAM for much cheaper.  ,Looks amazing and performs as listed. I chose the C14 timing variant because I had the budget for it. Sadly there is still no support for X99 boards, hence why it is running in rainbow mode - which actually looks amazing. It deserves 5 stars either way. Best looking RGB ram in my opinion.,I definitely did not need this much RAM, but I couldn't just put two in my rig, so here we are. Gorgeous.,Trident Z RGB delivers!  This stuff is great.  XMP 2 profile worked great.  No issues hitting 3200 speed.  32GB of ram is fantastic.  The color sync with ASUS aura works really well.  It's nice to have everything work off a single program.,It's expensive, but have you seen how cool it looks?,On a serious note, clocked to box speeds in a click, which is in itself crazy fast. Managed to briefly push my kit to 3333CL14 or 3400CL15 @1.375V, but given my memory controller is already strained from my chip OC, I didn't fight for it too much and went back to base settings. Good news is this is guaranteed to be B-Die since only Samsung makes 3200CL14,Oh, and it does look absolutely gorgeous, but yeah, it comes with the RGB tax. Don't get this if you don't care how it looks, you're throwing money out your windows.,So far a good deal on a good product,It's RAM.  Fast RAM.  Fast RAM with RGB. Works at 3200MHz with 14-14-14-34 timings with XMP.,Well, these LEDs are AMAZING and I really love how I can set the colors in 5 different areas. I have had random times where the LEDs just turned off randomly, but re-applying the color settings in the G.Skill program and it goes back to normal, eventually my first set just stopped working entirely though. I also have only been able to get my Ram to 2933MHz, this specific one isn't as compatible with the X370 Pro Carbon Mobo, so I recommend getting the 3200MHz one (GET CL14, NOT CL16) .

First time I set XMP at 3000 and tried booting and no go, Second time I think I set the XMP at 3000, then changed the option to Run For Stability rather than Performance, and it booted right up... has been running since then without issues.,Just wish the in-bios RGB Fusion would recognize it and it could match the RGB setup for the rest of the board.,A little overboard for RAM, but so far it's working better than I thought. The cool part is that I can change the color in the corsair ICue app.,Easy to update XMP, runs well so far with minimal testing, and looks great.,These guys have a lot of trouble communicating with corsair icue software.  The rgb is always going rogue.  They're also a little too tall for the cpu cooler... as in they barely fit right now and if I decide to do another 2x8gb for the other two slots, I don't think I can go with another two sticks of these unfortunately.,This ran at 3000 MHz right out of the box. RGB wasn't my main concern but I got it for $149, so I can't complain. "

I wanted to get 32gigs of this ram, but that meant I had to buy this twice. In addition, there is no version that does not include the two demo modules; so, if you don't plan on using them, then too bad. Also the RGBs don't blend together in the best way, so when showing multiple colors, you can clearly see the lines between the different lights.,Enough with the bad now with the good, the two demo modules means you can fill all 4 slots without spending extra cash. The titanium plates are beautiful and the rams looks amazing when stacked against each other. It's also 16 gigs of 3200mhz ram at a reasonable price and you can't go wrong with that.,I think you have to be a little crazy to consider these as they are around 1.5 the price of a pair of standard RGB 8gb RAM. 
This was purely an aesthetic choice for me, as I donât need 3200mHz or to have all 4 slots filled. I just âwantedâ to. ,I love the dummy modules. They allow me to fill up all 4 RAM slots with ARGB colours and add a nice âcompletedâ look to the case. They have a sleek aluminium finish and look classy compared to some of the bulkier ram. Easy to OC to 3200mHz. One issue is that they are a slightly different RGB colour to the rest of my build. That and the price is a little steep.,Also, since they are quite small, there is no clearance issues with bulky CPU coolers.,Runs 3200Mhz on XMP easily. Great RGB! Overclockable but haven't tried that yet. Low profile at 3.9cm. Perfect for my cryorig C1. still waiting for the AM4 bracket.,Fast memory that feels and looks decent.

Runs stable @ 3000MHz as rated in 4x4GB config.,It's fast, it's low, it makes your PC go.,While 8GB is on the verge to a bare minimum today, the memory itself is really high quality as to be expected from Corsair. Had no problems running them at even higher frequencies than they're rated for.,Anything over 2400 wasn't useful in this build but the price was right on this pack so I went for it. Low profile is a huge benefit here and Vengeance LPX is tried and true. Runs flawlessly.,Overpriced currently but does the trick. Got it stable at 2933 MHz right now. Low profile is nice for small case.,Great ram, does the job. Price is ridiculous right now but that has nothing to do with how well it performs, plus you can always get more along the way.,Really solid memory that runs at full speed without issue. Definitely worth it if you're in the situation I was in where the 2400 MHz equivalent is somehow $5 more expensive from the same vendor. I also really like the aesthetics of low profile memory over the bulkier stuff, so it has that going for it."

I originally wanted to go with G Skill Trident Z RGB DDR4 but found these Corsair sticks on sale at Best Buy for 115 each and could not pass up on them. Full RGB is nice as I can change the entire color scheme along with everything else whenver I feel the desire to do so. What I dislike about the RGB portion is that it is really limited on what it can display via the Corsair Link software. The choice of colors is fine but the presets are definitely lacking. I would like more customizable options within Corsair Link to make these exactly the way I want. As of now I just have them fading between two different colors, which the software limits to only two colors :(. ,As for operations - I have them all running at 15 15 37 3000mhz manually through BIOS at 1.35v. The pass memtest and ROG Realbench without issue so I am happy. ,Overall - 3 stars for personal opinion really. I am more than likely going to get the Trident Z RGB sticks soon but this ram works and works well.,The RGB's are nice, the plastic panel covering the top is poorly made and both can be removed fairly easily and taken apart, which shouldn't happen. It is nice and bright, and the memory is good once you overclock it.,It's really bling, but it wasn't too expensive and looks super good.,It's RGB and performs well. Overclocked to 3200mhz.,I don't even know why I have so much ram, but it's RGB,RBGski!!!!,Had issues with the frequency but all it needed was a little update and it worked great. Phenomenal lighting and customizable sequences, RAM can't get any cooler than this.,The memory Clocked up to 3000 no problem. ,The lighting effects are fantastic; however, I am not able to change them in the corsair link software as advertised.,I originally wanted to the Gskill trident RGB; however, Fry's didn't carry it, so I went with this memory instead.  Overall I am very satisfied witht he performance and appearance, but wish I could customize the colors in corsair link.,The heat spreaders are VERY tall.  I couldn't mount a radiator to the top of my case because of this.,Pretty and fast! Its RAM hahahaha,Good RAM, runs well. Lighting looks good although it's up to taste.

The high profile kits have no compatibility issues with the NH-D15 and the 1.65v xmp has a no hassle plug and play experience. Overclocking on this kit is on the below average side and the end result as with most memory oc and tighter timings, is not worth the overall potential instability or gains (AMD or APUs usually have more tangible returns on everyday overall performance scenarios, not just synthetics tests). 2500 is feasible with relaxed timings and 1.7+ voltage but 2600 gives out a strict refusal to boot regardless.

I was trying to get some Team group RAM on Black Friday, but they were out of stock and this was one of my alternatives. After checking a couple reviews and researching the general reliability, I decided to give it a shot- mainly because it was within my budget, was 3,000mhz speed, and was apparently 'Ryzen Approved'. It was also RGB, which was an unexpected bonus for this price range. ,Having used it, I have to say it's great. The XMP profile for the 3,000mhz overclock loaded without a hitch and the RGB looks fantastic. The heat spreaders for the modules are pretty tall, though, so you may want to check clearances first. I almost didn't have enough room for my top-mounted AIO radiator with this modules, but it just barely fit with less than a mm left. ,I tried overclocking it to 3,200mhz just to see if it would take and it didn't. 3,133mhz seemed pretty stable, but didn't show much of a performance increase, so I just set it back to the 3,000mhz profile. I'm not going to knock a star off for this though, because the modules are rated for 3,000mhz, not 3,200mhz, so they do exactly what they're advertised to do. ,Also, the RGB lighting synced up perfectly with the RGB Fusion software on my motherboard and was easily controllable. If you don't have any sort of software to control them with, they do a simple smooth color cycle that I find pretty tasteful. ,Overall, for $105 I think these are a really good value. ,perfect, rgb syncs with motherboard too, only complaint is that the heat spreaders are kind of cheaply made out of plastic, but its hard to tell in my case, oced to 3400 MHz stable.,Had an issue setting the XMP profile at first but it worked on second try. Love the RGB"

But the RGB on the GeILs is horrible - it can apparently , be controlled through the Asus Aura app, so on a non-Asus board, the RGB strips default to a bright rainbow cycle. As far as I can tell, GeIL has no software controller for its RGB memory. So I returned the GeIL sticks and got the Corsairs. These cost a few dollars more, but they are beautiful, and the Corsair Link software is pretty slick. It would be nice if these were compatible with the ASRock RGB software, but almost nothing is compatible with the ASRock RGB software, so I don't really blame Corsair. I haven't messed with the UEFI settings on these (other than manually selecting the 3200 XMP profile, which led to a red screen of death and boot failures), so I don't know if I can actually get 3200 speeds on my Ryzen board, but they're working great at whatever default speed the board has them set at. Maybe when ASRock gets around to putting out a UEFI update with AGESA 1.0.0.7 I'll get higher default speeds?,Works well and certainly looks fancy. Took it down a star due to the price of the package, DDR4 prices are horrendous right now.,Same here, corsair all the way. 16G was enough for what I needed and white/RGB to make the build looks fancy. ,Totally useless therefore utterly indispensable.,Pretty colors!

Just need the latest BIOS and set to ""Profile 1"" and bam, no more Ryzen memory speed worrying.,I want to give this 4 stars for not running at rated speeds, but I'm positive that's a Ryzen problem instead of a Corsair LPX problem. That said, people have been having much more luck with G. Skill b-die RAM and X370 motherboards when it comes to running RAM sticks at rated speeds. I have these rock solid stable at 2666 at 14-14-14-32 timings, which are speedier than the rated timings, so that makes up for not hitting 3200. Hopefully a BIOS update solves all in the future but I'm not stressing over it.,Looks and the brand is pretty good.,I does the job!"

After seeing both in person I thought the Trident Z looked way better, and I was able to find this 3600MHz kit at a decent (not great) price, so picked it up. I haven't done any overclocking, so the timings are a little loose, but the speed is nice.,Wasn't going to get RGB anything until I got the MSI Gaming X Trio 2080 and decided that at least one other thing should have some RGB. I wanted 3200mhz but the 3600mhz was on sale so it was a no brainer to just grab the higher overclockable memory. After some bios setting it hit 3600mhz with literally no more effort than a few clicks. ,I don't care about rgb all that much but damn the lighting effects are cool, also has a music mode,Beautiful looking RAM, I sync this with my motherboard. Syncing it to my GPU (I have a STRIX 2070) would not make the software work, so I synced it with the motherboard instead. I could've went with Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro or RGB Dominator Platinum to sync with my H115i, but I didn't want to buy dummy sticks for the Vengeance & the RGB Dominator Platinum is newer so I don't know much about how well it performs.,Solid. Ran at the advertised speeds right out the box after clicking on the XMP 2.0 profile. However, this is probably more due to 3rd gen Ryzen's better memory management rather than the ram itself. The lights are awesome, and G.Skills software has a lot of cool lighting options for personalizing your build. I went with the comet mode going opposite directions on each stick with yellow and white to match my theme, and I'm sure there is an option for everyone.,This was on sale. I had my heart set on another set of RAM but the fact these went on sale for a LOT cheaper than the RAM I was looking at and it still looks good in my build, I cant complain with that.,Paired with my mobo and CPU, these are one-key set up. You can forget all about timing and all that. Best looking RGB in the market IMO.,For added effects, don't forget to install G.skill RGB controlling software and set memory RGB control to ""off"" on your mobo RGB software."

I was able to easily achieve the advertised RAM frequencies with the default XMP settings. This RAM is the secret sauce for getting the most out of my 3900x. And I didn't see myself ever saying this... but the aRGB is 100% worth the extra cheddar.,Fast and pretty. Not much more to say. It OC'd decently. Nothing amazing. Great stock timings in the first place. Very good Memory overall.,Trippy colors options, definitely above average spec ram.

Runs quick and low latency with an XMP profile.,For the price, can't be beat.,This was the cheapest ram I could buy... hopefully I can figure out how to get proper performance out of it with my motherboard but I may have hooped myself on that one by not researching hard enough. I'm not giving it a great rating because G.Skill literally put crappy shiny stickers on it... for god knows what reason.... and they are already coming off.... wish there was proper heatsinks or something on them. ,Good memory. Shipped as a 2133 kit but goes to the advertised speed once you enable the XMP profile in the BIOS. ,I was worried because the QVL for these cheaper sticks of RAM (compared to corsair, RBG, etc.) didn't supposedly support AMD, but recent updates on the part of the mobo manufacturer/AMD have eliminated this issue and I had no problems getting these to run at their advertised settings using AMD's equivalent to XMP in the Bios settings.,Memtest also found no issues with these sticks and I am very satisfied. Fancy looking RGB isn't worth the additional $40 cost.,Not a good-looking memory kit. Then again, is the cheapest DDR4-3000 kit around and, for budget builds in cases with no windows or tempered glass panels, is excellent and quite reliable.,RAM is RAM but fast RAM is even better, especially for Ryzen. Overclocked it to 3200mhz without any issues.

Unfortunately I don't have a system with a strong enough IMC to actually push these and realize their true potential (I have them in a b450m board with a R5 2600), but I do have them running stable at 3400mhz c14 with pretty tight subtimings.

The semi-opaque nature of the housing for the LEDs cause it to glow properly, without the blinding effect that some RGB-ram has, or RGB-anything, for that matter. It really does look fantastic. I already have a Corsair keyboard, and was happy with the iCUE software, which seems to have a low impact on startup times and general performance, so I was fine continuing to buy into their ecosystem. Do note that it needs to be configured through their software. ,I was able to overclock to 3333Mhz, but since backed that down as I was afraid it might be causing the crashes. (Again though, only with Apex Legends) I also considered buying 32GB as the prices are relatively low, but decided against it as nothing I do uses anywhere near 16GB, and itâs an easy purchase if I ever need more, and at that point, it will likely be even cheaper.,Happiness with purchase: 9/10 - I love the beautiful RGB and donât mind running iCUE. I know itâs more expensive because of the RGB, but I accept that.,The build quality of the heatsink is superb and and the RGB looks really cool. I had no issues clocking it to the listed speed, might try overclocking later. For some reason I can only set the LED to a single color per stick but thats not to bad considering how nice it already looks. EDIT: This was because of a setting in iCUE called ""full software control"" which was already turned on but didn't have any effect. After disabling and enabling it again, it works, ,
This sticks of RAM look incredible and perform so as well. The lighting is bright and syncs to my motherboard. They are quick and have tight timings.

Performance seems great, runs at listed speeds.,So, I went for 4 x 8 GB instead of 2 x 16 GB because I wanted the RGB effect of 4 RGB RAM sticks. There was an option to buy 2 dummy sticks just for the RGB effect but that would cost a total of about â¬50 extra, which exceeded my budget. Installing the RAM kit was easy, it required a bit of force but the sound it makes when clicking in is delightful.,fairly pricey for just 3200 speed compared to others but I bought them because of other corsair products that I own.,By far the most attractive piece of RGB in this build.  RGB aside, it's memory, its at 3200Mhz and had zero problems hitting that with the XMP profile.  Sadly it's too tall to use the first slot due to the CPU cooler I chose.,It's in my opinion one of the best looking kits of RGB memory on the market right now. Worked easily at it's rated speed. Looks great. iCue software was easy to use and doesn't have to be run in the background after setting up RGB.,Great reliable fast ram. Really cool lighting effects. Glad I got this over the Trident.

But then Newegg Flash had a really good deal on these. I hadn't heard of Avexir before, but after doing some research about them I was really excited and decided to pick them up. These also have a little LED in them that fades on and off with a blue color. They are slightly offset with their timing which makes for a really neat effect inside the case. And they came in 16 gigs, so you know. There's that. Definitely worth it."

I purchased them more for their looks than their performance. ,Update-March 2018: As mentioned before, this RAM won't remain stable while overclocking, so I've been running at stock speeds.

However, this was a better deal than some of the other cheap RAM options.,This comes with a built-in heatsink and it's very compact. It's not flashy but it's RAM and it works. This brand, Mushkin, also sells the same RAM in an ""eco"" version which apparently uses less energy - it was the about the same price and I wish I jumped on that.,Since this memory isn't listed on here currently at an affordable price (currently $110+) be sure to use a search engine to look on another website for this product or the eco version."

Looks great and the included black heat spreader is great.,I read some reviews about dead RAM and other things. I never saw those reviews before I made my purchase (oops) but I'm happy to say that I've had no issues with this RAM. It works well in my build. I have a rig dual booted with OS X El Capitan and Windows 10 Pro and have no issues in either OS with this RAM. It's a good price for what it is. Soon I'll be buying another 2 x 8GB kit for 32GBs of RAM.,Good RAM for a good price.  16GB is more than enough for gaming and I have yet to run into any issues with this RAM.,Nice budget RAM, especially if you need something for a ddr3l Skylake build and don't want to spend a lot of money.  No issues at all (though RAM is rarely a problem)."

I wanted them to light up and show off. Since DDR4 RAM if fairly new, it is hard to find DDR4 RAM that has LEDs build in. But then i found these gems. With no previous reviews, and no images on PCPP, i was a little spooked, But if your looking for LED DDR4 this is the one to go with. It also has the highest clock speed of any DDR4 LED RAM that i could find.,Awesome ram that I never knew existed until I went through all the ram modules on pcpp. Heat spreaders are very tall so I could not see this ram being witha  large cpu air cooler.
The lighting is smooth and not overpowering,This ram was a great find, for the price normally decent ram comes without heatspreaders and LEDs on. It has this pulsating effect that makes the viewing window on my case worth the buy. It seems to run pretty fast, but I haven't completely put the PC through its paces to test it."

If you're using a Haswell CPU, make sure to set it at 1866Mhz, because it automatically puts it at 1333Mhz if you don't. I ordered those because CanadaPost lost my second pair of Corsair sticks and I knew that my motherboard would simply set it to 1600Mhz to make it compatible with the other sticks. I got a good deal on them on amazon and I bought them even though they don't fit in the case."

Performance is quite good, actually (at least there's been no ram-related issues), but I wish I'd picked up some 2400 or even 2800mhz RAM since the board I got is capable of that. Heat spreaders are a little tall but thankfully the cooler and board I got allows for as tall as you can fit. some of that. Solid 3 stars"

So I gambled on A-Data. Was a little worried that its voltage was a tad higher but hey I wanted 2400 so I think most voltages are 1.65 ,Installed easy and the heatsinks seem REALLY sturdy. Not that bad looking in the board adds a metallic flair that I like. Got it setup dual channel and it was recognized as 1600 when I put it in. Went in the bios, found the XMP profile 1 and its all good now"

It fit under the cooler, ran cool, and admittedly the breathing blue LEDs on it look amazing.,The main selling point of this RAM is obviously the color LEDs on it's spine. But they're pretty much BS. They have an uncustomizeable ""breathing"" system. But, while breathing on most LED things usually means slowly fading in and out, according to Avexir ""breathing"" means staying off for about 2-3 seconds, then fading on for a fraction of a second before fading back to black. And they aren't extremely bright, either."

Combined with the LEDs on my Asus Pro Gaming Aura motherboard, the inside of my PC is always a mini light-show that I enjoy seeing next to my monitor.,The lights are non-configurable in terms of color or timing, and there is no synchronization either so the two are always blinking at separate intervals, but they do turn off when the PC shuts down.,The breathing blue LED light effects are amazing,Patented LED lighting.

Match brands like G.skill and TeamGroup with ease and aesthetically pleasing for my build.,Haven't had any issues with this RAM. These have pulsing blue LED lights that fit with the frost theme. Some people may be bothered by these, as there is no way to disable the lights, but I don't find myself distracted by them. ,RAM with blue motive backlit. Looks very attractive, and so far no problem.,These things are awesome, I love the Blue LED pulses.  They perform well too.,WARNING: This RAM has colored LEDs, yes, but they are not constant, they breathe. And, if you buy two or more, like me,  you'll notice that they do not breathe in unison. It still looks good in my opinion, as it adds some movement, but some people might not like that. ,Otherwise, its RAM. Good for B150M boards that throttle memory at 2133. ,Holy buckets these are so good for the price. Blue leds look fantastic. Performance is also great. ,Very pretty and fast"

After some research online into some of the Tech forums I have discovered that I am not the only person who is have this or very similar issues with enabling xmp or simply over clocking the Memory sticks these sticks in particular, however these sticks are confirmed by AsRock that they are able to work with the motherboard and are even recommend by AsRock, this leads me to wonder if there is in fact a driver issue at fualt here or something misleading about AsRock's claims,**
So after even more browsing and searching, and finally coming to GSKill's spec sheets for these memory sticks, it turns out that they do not support any XMP settings.
The confusion on my part had more to do with the fact that NewEgg, who I purchased the memory from has them listed as being XMP programmed, which is now a blatant misrepresentation, if they ignore my feedback, as I have contacted NewEgg, staff and made them aware of the incorrect information.,Wanted to fill all four RAM slots on the cheap. Mission accomplished.

The pulsing lights look great too.,I have had a few issues with this ram. I occasionally get bluescreens for zero reason whatsoever. I cannot Identify the issue, I feel like it is mainly software, but I am not too sure about it. Doesn't overclock very well. Also has a very low clock speed. I wasn't aware of Ryzen benefiting from higher clock speeds until I had already bought the kit from Newegg. Best part about the ram is the lights, which are somewhat cool, they pulse depending on the current temperature of the ram itself.,I knew going in that this RAM wasn't the best timing-wise, but with timings more or less a thing of the past I went for 2 sticks of red LED and 2 sticks of blue. They alternate on and off and look good with the rest of the build. They made the SPD just fine, but I'm taking 2 stars off for a command rate of 2T."

No dead sticks.  Happy!,First time using crucial RAM, not much to look at compared to Corsair, but function quite well and didn't cause any major issues to overclocks.,Simply workhorses.,I like Crucial and have had good luck with their RAM before. These sticks XMP'ed to 2400MHz with one click as advertised. They look decent, and they don't get very hot.,seems to only run at 2133 hz.. maybe i have a wrong setting somewhere?
will update this rating if i get them to work at the intended speed.,Does what it says on the tin. No design on top of the heat spreader though which would have been nice. ,As I said, my Corsair memory broke, this works fine at a fine clock speed. ,See above only 8 gigs more,OC'd to 2666 with no instability. 10/10,Actually its a 1x16gb ram only..

The Dominator is on the QVL, this is not.  It's great RAM and it's actually Samsung B-Die, but it's not compatible.  Moving rating from 5 to 4 stars.,Original: This RAM is also an overkill for the 2400G.  While it's possible to get better performance with faster memory.  In practice above 3200 RAM, the CAS speeds begin to decline meaning that the combined speed is about the same.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find stability clocking this ram to anything greater than 3200 without a BSOD, probably related to the fact that this RAM was not on the official QVL list for the board, or the fact that officially the front side bus for the APU doesn't really support anything above ~2900.  However, I was also able to set the CAS down to 14 which speaks again to the idea that overall combination of frequency and CAS are related.  From a price perspective, 3200 14 CAS is actually more expensive today.,To really maximize an APU like the 2400G or 2200G though, you really need decently fast ram.  Unfortunately with current sky-high RAM prices, this flies in the face of the affordability.  However since my longer term goal includes more aggressive CPU and potentially higher workloads, splashing on good RAM makes sense.,APU scaling with faster RAM "

Going from the G.Skill Trident Z RGB memory, these do feel ""cheaper"".
I do like the little piece that is removable on top; unfortunately the Ram would not fit if I didn't take them out, do to my Corsair H110i being in the way.,What I mean by  feeling ""cheaper"" is that the G.Skill Trident Z had an obviously metal feeling, cold to touch and felt very high quality and sturdy.
These on the other hand, I had to double check that they were not plastic, because that is exactly how they felt.
But they are metal and performed better than my G.SKill, although I wish the LEDs had more customization like the G.Skill did.,Oh and also the plastic LED square on the Ram itself also scratched very easily and felt quite cheap compared to the G.Skill are well.
Overall none of that was worth losing a star over and I am very happy with this product.,My first purchase of RGB RAM and I have to say I love it especially with the UI interface for customizing the pattern settings. Price wise I think maybe a littler over the top but wanted it for the build. "

No issues!,It is ram. As mentioned I had trouble getting it to play nice with my MSI B350M Gaming Pro, but it works just fine.,I have had nothing but trouble with this RAM, but not for reasons you might think. For the first few months, the computer would turn up BSoD's with codes like ""Bad Pool Header"". After wiping and reinstalling Windows, we thought we had it down. We were wrong, and ended up running MemTest86+ from a boot drive. To our alarm, we received a stick of RAM with 9846 errors. I had to send both sticks back (even the one that worked) as per GEIL's RMA Rules. The customer service was extremely difficult to get in touch with and their website was far out of date. Customer service was based in China, which meant my 12am emails were responded to quite quickly (it being 2pm there) once I found the correct email address. ,I bought this memory on sale on Newegg for about $22.00 less than normal price, which might explain the defective stick.,Pros:,16GB for the price of some 8GBs,DDR4-3000 with CAS of 15,Heat-spreader,Cons:,First piece was defective,Below-par customer service,Substitutes:,For the price, it depends on the market. I see a Team Dark 16GB for about $65 at the time of this review,Kingston, Mushkin, or Corsair, and I would honestly do 4GB sticks next time,I actually got a GeIL EVO Forza, but it's identical, the only difference AFAIK is the cosmetics of the heat spreaders. Apparently GeIL is a pretty well-established company, just somewhat new in the direct-to-consumer memory category. Well, all I can say is the RAM looks great, and has gone straight to 3000 MHz without any issues once XMP is enabled on two different motherboards.,I wanted 16GB cause I like to game without closing my browser, which sometimes has like 100 tabs open. I was a little concerned it wouldn't be enough cause I hit 75% usage constantly with 8GB, but I haven't had any utilization  issues with 16GB at all. I did want to go for DDR4 RAM for future proofing, better performance, and now it's about the same price as DDR3 (and in that line, Kaby Lake mobo). I went with 3000MHz DDR4 RAM cause 2133MHz has pretty bad latency issues. In exchange, I went with a not so well-known brand. So far, it's been a great decision. The RAM looks nice and I've had no trouble hitting 3000MHz. I do notice that the system does do much worse when I don't have XMP enabled and the RAM runs at the default 2133MHz, so I suggest that everyone spend the $10 extra or so for faster RAM. Reviews online say that you maybe lose ""only"" 5-10% CPU performance and not to bother, but let me ask you: is 5-10% of your system performance worth $10?

Even 3000 is a bit overkill with the i7-7700k. If I overclock the i7 at 5.0Ghz it still can't handle RAM that fast. This might be due to my motherboard being somewhat eh or my CPU not being able to handle extra overclocking thanks to my rather weak cooler but it still is a great quantity and at 2400 it runs pretty fast. The LED is also a huge bump out of the regular profile of RAM. It gets in the way of my CPU fan cooler on the mobo I have and just glows blue. Pretty pointless, probably won't buy LED Ram again."

So these xtreme memory profiles is supported by some AMD boards, but not by all. So on all Ryzen boards, the highest that anyone has been ever to get these sticks to run is 2999Mhz. Some say its because they don't have Samsung ICs and other technical crap. Long story short, if you want memory that runs at its rated speed on Ryzen motherboards, then you need to check the QVL (Qualified Vendor List). There's no other way around it, and this is the only and biggest problem with Ryzen. You can't just go shopping for memory online and expect whatever you buy to work as advertised. Ryzen is not insert and play friendly with memory.,Anyways, the memory looks super sexy even if it is one color. It's a red LED light, and the only think you can customize is the lighting effects.

This RAM is pretty good and I got it for a good price so I'm happy with it. The only thing I've had a problem with is the frequency; for some reason the RAM has been underclocked from 1866 to 1600 MHz due to a BIOS error, I believe this was caused by the method of CPU overclocking I used when I first learned how to overclock - I somehow caused an error which stops my RAM from exceeding 1600 MHz, if it goes anywhere above 1600 then I get boot errors. Oh well, its no big deal, I'm sure a quick BIOS reset will fix it (but I'm not gonna do that).,Eh, I mean what can I say, this ram gets the job done. It was cheap and it performs well.

Well-priced, in fact at Â£33.18 it is better than the DDR4-2133 kit.,Not the fastest RAM, I bought mine refurbished, however. Still, It gets the job done, and with 2 of these 2x4 Gb kits I have enough RAM to run just about any game, and most RAM-intensive AutoDesk applications."

Well I always prepare for the future and since I was going all out why not 16gb. Im happy with the performance and I see a difference in the speed of this ram. I came from 8gb ddr3 800mhz? to this and hands down I recommend it...also it goes great in different colors!,It just works! No issues at all!
Looks great!,Its ram.,Does its job. Slight overclock used and no issues.  Good enough for my use.  ,This ram is nicely colored to make any of your build to the color you want. Love it!,The Kingston HyperX perform the same way as the more expensive Corsair Vengeance. This is the biggest reason why I chose them. I also really like the colour.,Great RAM. It is reliable and easy to overclock so I've heard. I'll have to see if I can squeeze 2133 out of these sticks!,I wanted 16GB for my multi-tasking and audio recording needs. I wanted fast but easy to use ram. I wanted it to look nice in my board. Kingstons Fury White 1866 DDR3 ram was perfect. It is smart enough to run at the max frequency the CPU allows, and since my CPU allows 1866 Ghz ram, it was the perfect choice. It felt good to hold, seems sturdy... I just love it.,Not gonna lie, Kingston RAM was picked solely off looks. Don't tell me it sucks..., But no issues so far.,Other than one of the RAM sticks being dead on arrival. It is a great buy, that goes amazingly with white themed builds."

Unsure if this is a me issue or a RAM issue. Could be both.,the corsair link soft ware sucks,Great memory kit all around as Corsair is definitely one of the leading brands. I picked this kit up for $310 which wasn't uncommon at the time and was also right before the RAM shortage hit which I saw this kit skyrocket past the $450 mark. The RGB glows bright but something to know is that you have to enable a setting in the BIOS so that Corsair's iCue and/or ASUS' AURA software can talk to the RAM for lighting control. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because one time my PC would refuse to boot just out of the blue and after tinkering with the hardware I was determining that one or two of the RAM DIMMS just weren't cooperating with my motherboard in certain slots. This may have been a motherboard issue (see my motherboard review and you'll see I gave it 4 stars also) as I eventually swapped the RAM sticks to different slots and all 32GB were being detected again.,They Look SICK :D,Works fine.

Might be a little plain looking but every set I've purchased overclocks right to the correct clocks and timing and does its job with no errors.,I didn't want to build this with 2x4GB of RAM, but I didn't want to go with one 8GB stick, due to the integrated GPU. With the high prices of RAM at the moment, I decided to bite the bullet and build it from scratch with 2x8GB. Selecting XMP profile 2 in the BIOS made a big difference to my CineBench GPU score.,Looks sleek and runs as perfectly as I could ask,All I did was set the XMP profile in the BIOS and it's been running smoothly. Temps are fine and I have no stability issues. I have not tried overclocking it though so that is the extent of my experience.,It's RAM. 16GB dual channel at 3000MHz/CAS15 with a heatspreader seems to get the job done and I got it at a reasonable price. However, its design doesn't pay much mind to being viewed from the top (as you will see it when installed in most PCs), so if you can find something with more attention to top-down aesthetics for a similar price and with similar specs (provided you care about that), I would go for that instead. It should also be noted that it is taller than base-spec RAM, at 42mm, and will potentially conflict with some old-school or very large coolers. "

Good price, good speed, god bless less play. ,I would give these RAM sticks 5 stars if only they were at a lower price when they were bought. The thing is, the problem is the same with all the RAM packs so this was my only choice. They are gorgeous and allow overclocking far beyond 2666MHz, but skill is needed to do that. 16GB of RAM are always appreciated."

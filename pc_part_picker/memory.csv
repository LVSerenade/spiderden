I didn't go out of my way to get Samsung B-die memory, but I picked up the most affordable color-matching 3200 MHz kit that was on the motherboard QVL, and it ended up being B-die. Great looking. VERY tight timings. I was easily able to reach the rated speed of 3200 MHz by enabling the XMP profile, with both the first-gen Ryzen 5 1600 and the Ryzen 3 2200G. I could probably overclock it to a higher frequency or tune the timings even tighter, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort when I'm already at 3200 and CL14. Expensive, but totally worth it, especially since first-gen Ryzen loves fast memory."

Nothing more to say.,Fast 2666 16GB RAM for quite cheap from a nice brand with good asthetics.,Great RAM, although my motherboard didn't detect correct speed, it was really easy to get it to proper speed.,I got this RAM cheap for about Â£80 so it was a great deal. High speed, works fine, looks good and a reputable manafacturer - what more can I say?,A little expensive but that is to be expected with the current cryptocraze going on. It runs without issue at advertised speeds and looks very nice. They doing feel as flimsy as some of the cheaper ran sticks I have used in the past.,Does its job well ,After looking around for ram that was compatible with my mobo, I ended up getting these bad boys. These are super fast and I used the XMP to get to 2666 and I am more than pleased with the speed. Paid: $174.95,No complaints. Good RAM. Fast. Does the job. Bang for buck.,These are the greatest memory sticks that money can buy. I'm a fan for life.,I almost couldn't afford a 2x8 kit, but these came on sale the week of Black Friday on Newegg so I jumped at them. I did need to adjust my RAM speed in the UEFI since the default had it reading 2133, but that was easy enough."

This is the second time i'm buying a pair of these because they're very reliable and look nice in most builds. This set goes at 3000 MHz and to be honest you wouldn't see much of a performance difference in mainstream uses. It feels great in the hand, looks great on paper, and is great in performance, what more to ask for?,Had trouble getting this memory to overclock very well. Wasn't able to get anywhere near 3000Mhz at any voltages. Best I was able to get was 2666 but admittedly I'm an amateur/novice overclocker. I'm sure I haven't done something right. Only saving grace is that I was able to get it for a good discount ($125 in Nov. of 2017 when average 16gb kits are around $150). ,Bought this kit because of great reviews and a decent price compared to others. With Ryzen the motherboard wont read the memory at what it should run at, mine is at 2133mhz even with the most current BIOS. Will update if I can OC and get it to 3000 or higher.,Update- Upgraded bios 3.0 and was able to ram speed to 2933mhz with no issues.,Clocked up to 3000 as advertised on XMP,Got this in a combo with the SSD from Newegg for $229. This may not be the fastest or coolest looking RAM out there, but I couldn't argue with the price (I may disagree in a few months if RAM prices come down). I was able to get it to run at 3000MHz very easily with a profile in the BIOS, so I'm quite pleased overall.,Good RAM, no issues both sticks pass memtest. Hear good things about RMAing with G.Skill.,The ram works as advertised after a Bios update. The heat spreader has a cheaper stamped and bent metal feel, but nice nonetheless.,I feel that with current memory compatibility concerns with certain CPU's, manufacturers should update their product pages to ascertain which memory module manufacturer was used, which leads to a reduction in rating.,Solid ram for my setup. Its working well with my ryzen 5 1600.,It does the job, looks nice, etc. Going from 2gb to 16gb of RAM was really an improvement. I have yet to use any more than 70% of RAM on any set of tasks I have set upon this rig.,Great for the price!"

It's perfect.,Got these low-profile because I thought I'd need the space. Turns out I didn't but... RAM is RAM, nothing really to see here.,Bought these on sale for $159.99 on NewEgg right before most 16GB DDR4 RAM sticks went above the $200.00. Originally, I wanted the black sticks, but they were sold out very quickly. These work great. They initially hovered around 2100 in the BIOS before I sped them up to 2933. So far so good."

The low profile nature of this RAM is great for large CPU coolers, and the non-hassle packaging is also a bonus!,Priced fairly (at least compared to similar ram), and performance well. Used the xmp profile on an x470 board, and all is good. Easy, trouble free, no complaints here. ,It works. One thing tho, this RAM got 16-20-20-38 timings which is not usual for CL16 RAM (I got Hynix C-die chips), I recommend slightly dropping timings to 16-18-18-36, I gained about 5.5 FPS in Arma 3 by doing that, will tune it further when I will have the free time.,Good looking and affordable. Performs like expected,Looks very clean.,I'd initially planned a white case and got this to match. Still looks good (I think) and it does the job. No problems getting it to run at 3000 though it's not one of the BIOS XMP profiles. Also this specific kit doesn't appear in the MSi QVL for the mobo but it does play nicely.,Looks good and is cheaper than other white ram such as G.Skill Trident Z.

Also, for you AMD Ryzen builders out there, I had zero issues getting this RAM to run at the advertised frequency, even a little above, and CAS despite not being on my motherboardâs approved list of RAM. These are also made specifically for Intel I believe, but like I said, not issues what so ever.,Bought two of these kits for 64GB total. 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 Samsung B-Die goodness.

I got the faster 14 timing. I'm not sure it would really matter, but I had the budget, and I figured it would probably give me a little flexibility should I do any overclocking. One annoying quirk, the LEDs go back into 'unicorn vomit' mode if I boot from a full shutdown. Also, the LEDs can only be addressed in Windows, which is a bit of a PITA for me, as I'm mostly in MacOS. Would RAM again.,G.Skill never disappoints. Memory came clocked at 3200 MHz as advertised. Just made some changes to the BIOS settings to allow it to use its full clock speed and it was off to the races. Planning on getting two more 16 GB sticks in the future. I'll have a server for a PC.,RAM was one of the most difficult components to choose: at the beginning all I knew was that I wanted a 2x16GB configuration but due to the many variants of modules offered by each manufacturer I really had no idea about how I could determine for sure whether one product was really better than another considering both frequencies and latencies.,After some research I found a very simple but - I guess - useful ratio that really helped me to easily find the real RAM speed for each variant, considering both its frequency and CAS: thanks to this simple frequency/CAS ratio I found a certain value (3200/14 = 228,57) for these 3200MHz modules with extremely low 14-14-14-34 latencies - by far the lowest I could find on the market - that could be overcome only by 4000MHz with CAS 17 (235,29 ratio) or 4133MHz with CAS 17 (243,12 ratio), in both cases costing much more due to their extreme frequencies (and also granting less MB compatibility).,Taking the example of a 3600MHz memory with CAS 17 (i.e. GSkill F4-3600C17D-32GTZR), I would get an inferior 211,76 frequency/CAS ratio, also paying more than I did due to its superior frequencies.,Does all this make any sense? I really don't know but I like to think it does.,No issues whatsoever. The RGB software is intuitive, if not a little clunky. It is easy to match colors with Razer's Chroma and NZXT's CAM software.,G.skill Trident: Thoughts I am happy as frak that this pair worked for OC this kit at time of purchase was not on the qmp list from either company so overclocking was a cross your fingers and hope for the best. Thankfully G.skill and Asus once again game in and delivered a product combo that just works and that all we want right?,This stuff does not come cheap but after tons of research I decided to go with the CAS14 @ 3200 as apparently the 2700x prefers this stuff.
Whether or not it is possible to tell the difference between CAS14 and Cas16 timings is up to the experts. 
To look at it's amazing. The RGB is very effective and totally controllable using MSI Mystic Light. I only have the 2 sticks which I thought might look weird but actually it looks amazing. "

I have run it on most all of the stilts default safe and fast settings from 3466 to 3200.  Have not stability tested them yet.  They run and make it thru games and benchmarks.  The higher settings do return higher benchmark scores.  If prices came down another 30% would look at higher speed rated sticks; these seem a good value at current prices.,As mentioned above I was going to have it price matched to $99 but they matched the mobo instead so I payed $139.99 for this ram but considering it's Samsung B-Die I can't really complain. I haven't done much testing or messed with the overclocking yet except I have tried to run the XMP to 3200 and it failed to boot with crash loops but I think the issue it I put the ram in A1,B1 and instead I should have used A2,B2 for 2 stick according to the motherboard manual. I'll do this soon and try out xmp and maybe some mild overclocking on it since it's B-Die and report back, only reason I haven't done it yet is I may have to take out the GIANT heatsink to switch the memory (see above noctua review)."

4 sticks usage is a bit complicated but still good. Fast preset works for rated speed - 3200 @ 14-14-14-28 (vs 14-14-14-31 from XMP) and 3466 @ 14-15-14-28.

Still fast as hell though, and LEDS :),Good sturdy Ram stick. I have not really tested much of the performance yet but the quality is much better than any other stick I have used. I feel like I could drop these out of a 3rd story window and they would still work. Corsair also offers tons of customization on these: LED fan cooling unit, LED conversion kit.,Running 4x8GB of these is most definitely overkill for current gaming demands, but what was I supposed to do... leave 2 DIMM slots empty!! High class, heavy duty RAM that runs at 3200Mhz out the box when paired with the 3600X.,
Just got this on sale for cheaper than what I bought the 2666mhz RGB Vengeance for. The silver on the Dominator memory goes perfectly with this build, so RGB isn't an issue.

That game is cpu heavy and the base game alone eats up 8gb of ram.. in order to fully enjoy the workshop contents, i needed to have more ram to futureproof myself from future game updates(they add more assets into the game per update).. At least i now know im futureproofing myself with 48gb of ram.. I chose red as it definitely fit my gpu color, so that inside of my rig wouldn't be a collection of random colors lol.. I definitely would love to upgrade in the future for a ram with rgb lighting.. Not the fastest at 2400mhz, because when I built my rig, I was trying to cut corners on some price, and I thought I can sacrifice the ram speed.. I definitely would love to upgrade one day for a 3k mhz ram.. Price at the time i bought my 16gigs was still good before the mining craze jacked up the ram stick price up.. The 32gigs i bought was probably expensive due to mining craze, but cities skylines made me swallow the steep price to get more ram.. Nowadays in 2019 with mining craze fading away, ram prices are going down, but not as good as pre-mining craze..,Good quality RAM that's compatible with a variety of boards.

So this is a cheap option for B-Die and good RAM for Ryzen. Currently running stable at 3000 on my Ryzen 5 2600 build. Asus Aura has no issue controlling the RGB. ,to use Aura sync, first download the patriot software and turn off the lights, uninstall that and then install the Aura software specifically for Patriot! not the Aura software found in the support section of your MOBO. Enjoi,So a little about myself, I research things...a lot, probably too much. So when the task of choosing RAM came about I started my journey on researching the best RAM to run with a AMD 450 chip set mobo. Thereâs everyoneâs go-to: Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB, Gskill Trident RGB which people have run without issue with AMD but a lot of people have also experienced problems with those popular choices with AMD chipsets, so I dove a little deeper. The main issues it seems stemmed from the 350 chipset, not the 450 which I ended up running (Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming) but I still didnât want to chance it. I came across Team Tforce RAM which many AMD users had a lot of success with, I thought I had found the one. But of course I didnt stop scouring the internets, reading reviews and blogs and combing through countless QVLs. I then came across Patriot Viper RGB RAM. Read every review I could find on Newegg or Amazon. 99% were great with most people getting the advertised 3000mhz or 3200mhz with AMD chip sets. But then I dove a little deeper and looked at some blogs. Not only were people getting the advertised clock speeds but every review I read people successfully overclocked them easily getting 4000+mhz while keeping their system stable. So at the end of what seemed like preparing to write a thesis on what RAM is best for AMD chip sets and overclocking stability I decided to go with the Patriot Viper RGB 3200mhz 16gb kit. I havenât had to time to spend to overclock it but I am getting the advertised 3200mhz right off the bat and I don't think I will have an issue pushing it further.,Clocked at 3200 with no issues.,Fast stable love the color ratation"

I havent messed around with it too much yet, but with XMP enabled, i have set it at 2666mhz and it is flawless.,Corsair is always a good choice. I was looking into G.Skillz RAM to pair with my Ryzen, but the Asus mobo didn't have any above 16GB that were verified and/or rated well. I fell back on Corsair  (a guaranteed brand) and couldn't be happier! ,Be careful to check the throttle on your Motherboard, as I had to do some tinkering with voltages to get above the stock 2133. Currently, 2666 is running smooth. I will look into getting closer to that bench of 3000 with more troubleshooting in the future. ,The real deal. Just as I imagined they'd be - build construction and quality is so solid. They feel great, look great and perform great. Simply applied the XMP profile and might try overclocking after a few weeks. Opted to stick with two sticks for single Dual Channel performance; no regrets there.,A little pricey, but they are aesthetically pleasing and that is half the battle. ,Cheapest 2x16GB RAMs on Amazon I could find with a one-day shipping.

Although the aesthetics have no baring on performance and in this build, will most likely be never seen, for the photos included = badass, aha.  ,If you're looking for high capacity fast RAM, this is a very nice option. I can't imagine there's a ton of people that NEED or really care that much about the speed and CAS latency, but, for those of us who do - I wasn't disappointed. It also has very faint white LEDs under the heat spreaders. Just enough to accent - not enough to draw attention."

Wouldn't have bought this if it wasn't on sale but for almost the same (inflated) price of normal RAM I thought I might as well.

Looks great especially in white and syncs nicely with I cue software to match all the the other Corsair products. Highly recommend!,Can't review the speed or latency beacause i can't see difference between two similar rams, i have 24Go of 2400MHz( on xmp2.0) c16 and its work very well.
But RGB is reaaaly impressive, you can do every effect you want and light effect look really good, Great heat speader too.,Reliable RAM, overclocked to 3600 MHz,Only complaint is that the RGBs can only be controlled with iCUE."

None of the RAM kits currently available in 2x16GB configurations hit my previous CAS/size requirements, so I stuck with 2x8GB for now. Oddly, UEFI/BIOS recognize this RAM's bandwidth at 2133MHz, and the decorative sticker that came on the RAM is pretty low quality stuff.,The stickers on the sticks look rather cheap in my opinion.,works perfect at rated speed. I do, however, think it's pretty lame to have stickers on the sides printed to look like heat shields.

No issue overclocking to 2400 using the included XMP profile.,A bit expensive at local market., As Low Profile as DDR4 can get. These have no heat spreaders, just a black and red sticker covering up the sides. Dropped it in an ASRock Z370 Mini ITX Board and it took off and ran just fine.

As far as the RGB feature, you will not find anything better.  The colors are bright and very fluid.  Knocked a star off only because of the price.  If you do not care about the RGB aspect of RAM, you can get some very affordable high performance RAM for much cheaper.  ,Looks amazing and performs as listed. I chose the C14 timing variant because I had the budget for it. Sadly there is still no support for X99 boards, hence why it is running in rainbow mode - which actually looks amazing. It deserves 5 stars either way. Best looking RGB ram in my opinion.,I definitely did not need this much RAM, but I couldn't just put two in my rig, so here we are. Gorgeous.,Trident Z RGB delivers!  This stuff is great.  XMP 2 profile worked great.  No issues hitting 3200 speed.  32GB of ram is fantastic.  The color sync with ASUS aura works really well.  It's nice to have everything work off a single program.,It's expensive, but have you seen how cool it looks?,On a serious note, clocked to box speeds in a click, which is in itself crazy fast. Managed to briefly push my kit to 3333CL14 or 3400CL15 @1.375V, but given my memory controller is already strained from my chip OC, I didn't fight for it too much and went back to base settings. Good news is this is guaranteed to be B-Die since only Samsung makes 3200CL14,Oh, and it does look absolutely gorgeous, but yeah, it comes with the RGB tax. Don't get this if you don't care how it looks, you're throwing money out your windows.,So far a good deal on a good product,It's RAM.  Fast RAM.  Fast RAM with RGB. Works at 3200MHz with 14-14-14-34 timings with XMP.,Well, these LEDs are AMAZING and I really love how I can set the colors in 5 different areas. I have had random times where the LEDs just turned off randomly, but re-applying the color settings in the G.Skill program and it goes back to normal, eventually my first set just stopped working entirely though. I also have only been able to get my Ram to 2933MHz, this specific one isn't as compatible with the X370 Pro Carbon Mobo, so I recommend getting the 3200MHz one (GET CL14, NOT CL16) . People seem to be having less problems with those.,After bios updates killed my last set of RAM, the current set has remained to be ""lit"""

The mobo will support 4 DIMM, so I can add a 16gb kit later.,Runs as advertised. Although I had to manually set the DRAM voltage to 1.35V to keep from crashing even in normal use (Auto 1.2V was not enough to run at 3000MHz).,RAM: Since I was doing a Photoshop PC, I needed at least 16GB RAM starting off and it does deliver.
I hope I have it configured/setup so that it`s running at peep , also looks cool and dark in my case."

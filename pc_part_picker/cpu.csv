Got minor issues with BIOS and temps but latest drivers fixed them,At 199.99 this CPU is a great deal. It matches the Intel i7-9700K in single threaded performance, exceeds in multi-threaded performance, and does it all with less power and almost a $150 lower price tag (at the time of this writing). Yes, one could buy the 3600x or the 3700x for even more performance, yet the Ryzen 3600 seems to be adequate for the majority of gaming workloads. ,Happiness with purchase: 9/10 - Fantastic value. Kept my build price down significantly, and does everything I need. I sometimes wonder if I should have gone with a 2700X, though that would have inflated the build price.,Mine hits 4.1924 GHz, which is spot on for a 4.2 GHz box rating. Quite a nice step up from my R5 2600.,Lives up to the hype. There isn't much else to say about it., ,
This CPU has been reviewed by many reliable sources who go further in depth than I ever could but all I can say is that this CPU can tackle gaming, editing and rendering all at good temperatures.,Great CPU, however when I overclock I get worst performance then if I leave PBO and auto overclock on,For the cost, there is absolutely nothing I can say negative about it! One of the best cost to performance processors out there today!,Ryzen 5 is alive! Without any overclocking it seems ready, willing & able to tackle whatever comes its way.,Probably the best brand new budget cpu for gaming and productivity. A huge improvement over the i5 4570. 10/10 would buy again.,The price to performance on this chip is amazing. There's a reason it's coming in on the #1 'best overall' spot on a lot of CPU 2019 round up videos/reviews around the Internet. I do a mix of gaming and design work, and it never misses a beat. Can't recommend this CPU enough."

A couple of notes about Xeons; the E3 series is comparable to an i7 of the same generation (e.g. E3 V3 is Haswell, V2 is Ivy Bridge), none are unlocked for overclocking, and many of them don’t have an IGPU (nomenclature ending in 0 or 1). I point out the lack of IGPU for gamers that also record their sessions. Intel quick sync video requires the IGPU, and can be quite helpful for video encoding.,Affordable 'entry' CPU in terms of the 4-core, hyperthreaded (HT) realm, good for those needing multithreaded horsepower in a pinch.

The price point is almost identical between the V3 and V4 models, but with the V4 you get an additional 2 cores (at a reduced speed), along with support for faster RAM, larger cache, etc.,Rarely do I get more than 2 cores above 50% load because the OS is spreading the processes across the cores beautifully. Runs really cool under the X62 Kraken."

The CPU PassMark score is 13,059, compared to the slightly more expensive E5-2690, that has a CPU PassMark score: 14,315. This is a decent processor for rendering video and editing photo's...and if you enjoy light gaming, this CPU will hold its own. If you are using dual Xeons, it is best that they are paired, but if you cannot find a pair, then at least ensure the core stepping are the same. This is an LGA 2011 Socket R processor, so ensure you match this CPU with a LGA 2011 Socket R Motherboard...cannot use LGA 2011 V2, V3 with this CPU. "

This is a very strong CPU for an older, or cheaper, build. I still am incredibly satisfied.,Awesome processor for $74.89. However, I purchased mine while they were still in the store(work at Frys Electronics) and they were tagged at 180$. Still not terrible, but they weren't completely honest about the black series (hence the class action lawsuit) and if u ask me, this series is garbage.

I'm not a fanboy for Intel/AMD/Nvidia/etc.. but I am a GIANT fanboy when it comes to tech and this processor makes my inner fanboy nerdgasm daily lol,Absolutely love this beast! If you had told me last year that there would be a 10 core CPU that overclocks to 4.7Ghz like it's nothing I would have laughed at you! Here we are though and I could not be more happy with where technology is today! This is a very powerful CPU and while it is a little hot, it's nothing a delid can't solve! Well worth the money and I would recommend the 7900X looking for a good enthusiast processor!,For the hefty price tag you would hope this is a five star item.  I'll be honest. I read the reviews from other sites and when I hit the order button my heart sank.  I was coming from an i7 4790k and thought that the performance gain would be lackluster.  ,I was wrong, I was very, very wrong.  Holy god. This thing is a monster.  When I opened the box angels sang from above, the heaven's opened, Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit all ran to me and screamed ""I can't believe you bought this! It costs sooo much and no one needs it!"" While true, if you're looking to do a ludicrous build, this should be your cornerstone.  Overall, an excellent purchase, and something I would recommend doing at least once in your life if you have treat-yo-self money.,TL;DR: If you're even bothering to read this post, you should go ahead and buy it.  If you're looking for someone to tell you that you don't need it, and you will be happier with an i7 and won't regret not picking this one, you're going to need to look elsewhere.,For the price you better hope this is worth five stars.,This thing is a monster. Everyone said, ""I can't believe you bought this! It costs sooo much and no one needs it!""  But I do NOT regret buying this monster at all.,Wonderful CPU ! Temp is low with water cooling.. Could easily OC to 4.9 but stopped at 4.6 for now since I do not need the extra performance.   ,The cpu is fast but way too hot at the Intel boost settings. The 2 fan liquid cooler will not get the job done. Next week I will upgrade to a 360 radiator,Selecting the I9 7900 was the correct choice for me, well for gaming the most cores needed are 8 from what I researched. I9 was 10 and performance is great. A real Beast!! It was delidded and binned by Silicon Lottery @ 4.7GHz, Currently running at 4.3 GHz smoothly. Will raise the speed when I get a little more familiar with the new board.,Definitely gets hot when running on higher clocks. "

But still, on a  budget this CPU is a awesome choice.,Works great for the price and met all expectations. In hindsight, I should've gone for something with hyperthreading, but this works as advertised. ,Awesome little processor that can be found on the cheap side.

I would recommend this to anybody that is on their first gaming build.,4 cores and 4 threads with plenty of power for my needs. I picked a non overclocking chip for longevity purposes. This thing is blazing fast and has great thermals thanks to the refresh. I moved from a dual core celeron so you can only imagine the power difference,Beautifully efficient processor. The only reason I don't give it five stars is due to no overclocking potential.,Fantastic CPU, no complaints. MicroCenter (which has been mysteriously removed from PCPP as of late) had this for $159 and I got the motherboard bundled for an additional $20 off, which was a deal I couldn't refuse. In fact, most parts for this build were bought at Micro Center. ,The CPU blazes right through gaming, including games that could be classified as reasonably CPU-intensive. I haven't observed any GPU bottlenecks thus far, and of course it handles the everyday tasks such as YouTube and Skype well.,I'm docking a star for the stock cooler, which is a little subpar in my opinion. I understand it's just a stock cooler and not to expect too much of it, but still. I could barely hear any noise at all, while temps shot through the roof-but the fan was already on max speed. ,It's what you would expect. 4 cores, 4 threads, 3.3-3.5 Ghz. Not much else to say. ,Oh yeah it's the minimum spec for VR if I can ever afford that. "

They guarantee stability at 4.5GHz and 1.175V VCore, with AVX offsets of -3 and -5, and they don't lie. Using those settings and prime95, I got one core up to 85C, with a couple of others in the low 80s and some in the high 70s. Maximum power was about 225W. No problems whatsoever, rock solid.,At idle, all cores are sitting in the mid to high 20s.,Unfortunately I pulled the trigger on the CPU purchase way too early. I paid $680, and today you can get (slightly) higher spec'd processors for quite a bit less.,An fast CPU with it's 8 physical (or 16 virtual) cores and at 3.6 GHz. I overclocked it with 4.0 GHz without problems. I hope I can calculate my chess games even faster now ;P . Also price is more tha acceptable for that power.
1 point down: It has only 26 PCI lanes.,Fantastic for simulation.  Runs Hot.  Not a good CPU for gaming. ,lighter than i thought and very small arrived ok is still fine. not tried any plex 4k transcoding yet.,Amazing. Used the ASRock easy overclock and set it to 4.7GHz.

Currently there is no need for more performance for my LAN rig!,The 4460 has so far handled everything well, including some very light gaming without a GPU (20-30 fps on Heroes & Generals, nothing great). What I love most about this processor is that it runs cool. Even under load with my audio software (Reaper), I've never seen temps go above 45'C, and idle temps are a chilly 28-30'C on average. High temps are something we all want to avoid, but it's especially important in a home studio build where you don't want your fans ramping up and increasing noise levels. You could spend another $10-$15 for the extra 0.1 GHz gain of the i5-4590 if you wanted, but the tiny difference in performance would not be worth it in my opinion.,I'm quite pleased with the Intel 4460, working on it (CAD programs) is perfect, also light gaming. It wasn't a bad choice, had a good enough price/performence ratio.,It seems to work just fine - as a non-gamer, I was not interested in anything more spectacular, and it fitted my budget. The stock cooler seems very quiet and efficient - although I am comparing it with our old PC which sounded like the air-conditioning in a car being put on full blast.,Didn't plan on overclocking and i'm not into extreme editing so this was a clear and cost effective choice.,I was going to build a fairly cheap basic build based on the AMD FX-6350 but eventually decided on the Intel as i have the possibility to upgrade to an I7-4790K in the future. For the work I do this seems to be quick enough.,I needed i5 for the games I wanted to play, so I choose this. The main reason I picked the i5-4460 is because of the 0.2 GHz over the i5-4430 for just $10 more.,Serves me well.,Its only downside is that it struggles in cpu intensive open world games. The only game I play that's like that is black desert and I BARELY play it so this isn't anything crazy.,Good quad core CPU."

It's one of the best CPUs you can find under USD 60.00, if not the best. Although clock speeds aren't very high, its single thread performance is more than enough to satisfy office and domestic users, and the cores are strong enough to push an entry level GPU such as the GTX 750 Ti/R7 360 or even the GTX 950/RX 460 with little to no bottlenecks. Is also runs very cool, even with my cooler poorly mounted the CPU barely reached 70º C, and with the cooler properly installed it never surpassed 40º C, all this with the CPU cooler fan locked at 20%. Bottomline: amazing cost/benefit ratio, if you're in for something cheap and good, pick this one.,A good entry-level CPU that's perfect for basic builds, don't expect it to do so well with more demanding games though.,Great processor and the only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because the g4560 is the same price basically for better performance. :/ that's all,I'm very happy with it. Haven't had any problems with it so far, stock cooler keeps it at a decent 40 C on full load, and everything runs super fast. I've yet to render a video, but I will do that next week and update this review accordingly.,For basic computer use this CPU will work fine. I think that this is Intels most interesting budget CPU that they have released in years, mainly because of how cheap it is. Nearly half the cost of an i3 7100, yet still hast the same , but no hyper threading. It retailed at about $65 when it came out and I got it for $50. I could have went with the G4560 for around $35, (or g4600 for $30 more depending on availability) more than what I paid for the 4400, but I seen no use in having it hyper threaded for the price.,Fantastic! This little processor handles everything I've thrown at it. It's installed in my HTPC which doubles as a Plex server, and is on 24/7. Nothing seems to phase this little guy! I've ripped Blu-rays, compressed 30GB+ .mkv files to more reasonable ~2GB .mp4 files, and I've done some mild gaming on it. Paired with a GTX 750 Ti, I've been playing Fallout 3 at 1080p60 with all settings on ultra high, no hiccups at all. Considering the price you really can't go wrong with this little processor. Its low TDP makes it a great choice for a HTPC/Plex server too. It's certainly better suited for media playback than ripping and converting video files, but it can do it if you need it to. I really cannot say better things about the G4400, I've been very surprised and happy with its performance. Simply a great value.,for a dual core and non-hyperthreading processor,I'm not expecting too much but the good thing is , i can even Run GTA V at decent FPS on high settings and most new games from 2016 and some newly released game this year. but i suggest if you're gonna build a budget rig this year, go for G4560 kabylake , it's hyperthread processor and almost at the same price.,Only 2 threads, bottlenecks almost every game,This CPU works like a charm. Even if it's half a bill and sucks even next to a locked i5, Skylake is cool and efficient, and it will be more than enough for my dad for the next 3 years."

Should hold up for many more years.,Although I got this right before the 4790K this will keep me going for years to go, especially with the next gen. improvements like DirectX 12 & Vulcun that distribute the work load more evenly.,what more can i say its perfect!!,Great CPU! Even with its age its performance is outstanding and the price stability tells everything about the quality of this CPU,Been using this for 4 years in a few different builds. Absolutely a beast.,Gets a little hot, recommend a good cooler.,Still doing great though it's only a 4th gen Intel CPU. Really no reason for me to upgrade to a newer platform, since it's performing fine for my usage. I managed to overclock it to 4.2 GHz @ 1.105v (manual), running around 30-35c idle and ~70c at full load.,I think I won the silicon lottery with this one. I've been sitting at 5GHz for nearly 3 years on liquid cooling with zero issues. Benchmarks put it just a bit higher than the 6700k. Great processor."

At the time, Intel's main consumer line did not offer more than 4 cores/8 threads, but I felt that 6 or more cores would be important for future proofing, and I knew I wanted this CPU to last me at least a few years.,That being said, if I had to do it again I would (and will going forward) stick to a more frequent upgrade cycle with top-end , products, e.g. i7-8700k and similar. This is because some of the problems I have had have been rare and hard to find support for. Intel + the mobo manufacturers spend more time, resources, and visibility in supporting the mainstream market. The customer base for these HEDT chips is smaller and so support has just been more limited overall. That's why I would recommend, and personally will be, sticking to mainstream consumer parts in the future.,See my review of the ASRock X99E-ITX/ac mobo as well for additional details.,GOOD CPU -1 because of the price,As advertised. A work horse that runs hot, takes a lot of energy. But does the job. ,Awesome CPU. Great overclocking and overall performance.,Great and inexpensive Intel Extreme processor.

The 6 cores were worth it. Runs tabs, games, and windows with no hassle.,Can't give a performance based review on this just yet, but based on my research this was a good choice for the price point. We would get better multicore performance with an AMD equivalent but when I discussed this with my friend he wanted to focus on gaming rather than editing given the choice. ,My only frustration with this CPU is that it has made me realize how bad my timing was in building my own system. I originally planned on installing an i5-7600k or i7-7700k in place of my Pentium G4560. A few months later the Coffee Lake family came out. I know that the actual difference in performance from Kaby to Coffee lake won't be horribly noticeable for my daily use, but it drives me crazy that I will be spending $200-350 for an unlocked processor that is outperformed by locked processors that can be bought for $20-100 less. ,The chip is exactly what I ordered, so not much to review here.,I did opt for the non-K versions while pricing these out because I was not planning on overclocking, and wanted to see how I liked the stock CPU fans.  My review will be based solely on the included fan and instructions.,The Fan has factory applied thermal paste, which was in good clean condition and no additional thermal paste was needed.  The instructions left a bit to be desired, regardless to the fact that installation is relatively straight forward.  The only issue I ran into was the push clips were already turned in the LOCK position which made it difficult at first to push the clips into place.  Once I realized they were locked, it was easy enough to turn them, release the locking pins and push the clips into place.,The instructions have NO words for instructions, just a picture.

It overclocks great, too. Was able to bump this to 5.0Ghz with no issues.,Not the greatest value new currently, nor the highest thread/core count. Definitely an amazing deal for the price I got it for though.,For an i3 CPU, this puppy actually manages to be very good overall. As a quad-core CPU with good overclocking capabilities (I've got mine set to 4.5Ghz at 1.27v), it's easily a match for the previous generation i5 chips, and much cheaper overall. The 8th gen i5 and i7 chips will likely be better for gaming, especially in the future, but at 1080p 60hz this CPU does just fine for even most modern AAA games.,Excellent price to performance ratio. Easily matches and outperforms the last gen chips in the I3 and I5 series. Runs fairly cool and overclocks well so far.,The little quad core that could. It's a good processor,I paid 156 for it brand new from eBay and have since seen them for as little as 132 dollars (USD),New 8th gen coffee lake doesnt disappoint. 4 Cores/4 threads at 4ghz out of the box outperforms the previous staple for gaming, the i5-7600k. Allows for overclocking, but downside is you have to buy a new 300 series mobo.,The 8350K really is a great CPU. Despite questionable pricing at release, at $135 there is no better bang for your buck for gaming when overclocked. You do need to spend an extra $20 to get a Z370/Z390 board, but it easily outperforms popular non-K i5 CPUs and hangs with my overclocked 8700K in most games. The i3 obviously falls behind in applications where hyperthreading matters, but there's not much incentive to buy up the stack if you're only gaming.,I mostly use my system in single threaded applications. I needed a processor where I could get the maximum CPU clock speeds.  The i3-8350K processor is ideal for my applications. I am able to over-
clock the 4 cores to 4.6GHz and have a very responsive system.  I deducted 1 star because of high
cost of the processor otherwise I would have given it 5 stars,Easy pick, and really good for its price and does not disappoint."

I don't overclock. Still very speedy! About a $100 cheaper than the low-end I7, but with about 80% of the processing speed. CPUBenchmark shows the Kaby Lake I5 7600 about 10% faster than the Skylake 6600. Most of that is probably attributable to the higher speed (3.5 GHz v 3.3). ,The stock fan is fine, but other fans appear to have more secure methods of mounting to the motherboard. You have to be careful to get the pins inserted and locked correctly. And since this was my first build in more than a decade, I didn't know that the stock cooler comes with wet thermal pasted pre-applied to the bottom of the heat sink. It's messy; be careful. ,Only marginally more expensive than the 7500 so I jumped for it. I'm not really qualified to give it a technical review, but so far so good on all fronts. The stock cooler comes with thermal paste already on there!,Nothing much. Just want to match with GPU for less bottleneck.,Excellent performance. Was tempted to wait for AMD Ryzen but given it's initial lack of I-GPU it would not have been suitable for HTPC (I didn't want to add a discrete GPU). ,@ 3.5ghz 4C/4T this CPU handles multiple VPC's and services fine.,Would have been nice to have the  i7 7700  but couldn't justify the extra $140 for minimal performance benefit."

I figured why not hit the upgrade cul-de-sac? Started with an A8-7600, but that's going into something much smaller. This A10 is noticeably more athletic but still not a lot to brag about. Fine choice for a designer novelty rig like this.,Amazing performance for an APU. Use with high frequency RAM.,This was my first, and in my opinion this is one tough processor with not bad graphics.  Truthfully I really like my AMD A10-7890K. It's Tops,This processor is truly amazing for the price. the graphics runs smoothly on GTA V. use high frequency ram because the integrated graphics use ram installed in the board.,Underclocked this to 3.0Ghz.
In my experience this clock does not affect the speediness of the general feel of this computer.
Lower temperatures were an added benefit.
This gives me room to overclock it in the future (Because I really want to slap a cooling block like it's a Hemi on a '69 Charger)
This APU is good enough for the everyday user and some.
Gaming on League at 60fps?
This can do 75-85fps on 1440p. (Average users are still slowly running 1080p monitor.)
This was run with 2 Acer 1440 60hz monitors.
Take note that the ram needed to be overclocked to 2133 to achieve these results and I did not change any volt settings to do this.
I think I can up the ram to 2400 but I would have to up the voltage to the ram to 1.6v (Stock is sitting at 1.5v)
This can run OBS and record videos albiet you will need to lower settings to 1080p and on 30fps. You can probably run this in 60fps recording with another ""low-profile"" r7 250 which I am still waiting to receive.,Overall this CPU is more than enough to last a few years.
I'd put my money on 5 years or more depending on the user.,This build gets cheaper everyday, and worth more than spending $500 bucks on a console. This can run emulators as well.,A good APU but sadly mine is not much of an overclocker. I can only get a stable 4.3GHz overclock.,Absolute monster of an APU. Great path for upgrades in the future. I'd recommend either an RX 470, a GTX 1060, or what I will do, an RX 480. The wraith cooler is also dead silent and stays cool.,performs as an apu should, would of liked to see a little more from it before overclocking.

Runs hot just like any other AMD. GPU is squarely in the ""not bad"" category and still some of the best you can get onboard without spending a small fortune on top end Core i7 with IrisPro. The onboard GPU is its big sell so don't mess with the APU series unless you are specifically avoiding discrete video or don't have room for it...or you got one for free ;-)  Would probably not purchase one again, opting instead for a bigger box with discrete GPU. Very niche.,Overall, great little APU. It's no performance king vs it's AM3+ bothers or intels cpu's but it will allow you to play your games and work on other productivity task at need.,Pros: 
1. It's overall fast for most needs with 4 cores for your needs. (It matches my stock Core i7 920 in most tasks.),This APU also allows you to build a compact system without a gpu or allows you to have some graphics in your system for now and to be able to save your money for a dedicated gpu down the road.,Also useful for keeping temps under control if your using a cooler that cant perform under the cpu's full load.,And I think this Apu could go farther if it was on a better motherboard but im limited to ITX motherboards in my case. ,Although I do have a con about the overclocking.,Cons:,Unless you adjust the TDP target or have a good cpu cooler, be prepared for the stock cooler to be running like a jet when you have any load on it. ,If you have both gpu and cpu sides of the apu @ 100% loaded, the cpu will downclock itself (i've seen it go as low as 3GHz). This issue only disappears when the gpu is not loaded.  ,They report the temperature in Thermal Margin. As in, How much overhead you have till you hit the max temp. So big numbers like 70c is really good. Small numbers like 5 or 10c is really bad.,To monitor temps, You'll need to use AMD overdrive software. ,Becoming a fan. If you are thinking about an i3, think about this one instead. ,This APU is a beast! Stays quiet even under load (until you add a dedicated GPU, MSI R9 380 4GB in my case, which runs quiet but really heats up the APU because it sits so close to it. You can add a liquid cooler to get rid of that problem). It can handle many games at 1080p. Games such as GTA5, FarCry 3, Saints Row IV and the like run in console quality and sometimes better.,Decently fast cpu, good onboard graphics.,Don't build a system with an APU for over $350. Its not worth. Works great tho!,Fine for what it is.,
Not going to be equal to a good CPU + GPU set-up for games.,
Has powered my Linux PC with no problems at all.,Great for entry level pc. not so good for high end gaming. I will say its a good overclocker, I got my chip to 4.4 ghz stable but that may vary from chip to chip. best left to apu builds,This chip is amazing! It plays every game I have. Not at the best settings (obviously) but at acceptional ones.,I currently have this overclocked to 4.4 on the CPU and 960 on the GPU. Running stable so far, no issues. As long as you spring for decent ram, 2133 speed or better, you will get a good response from this chip.,Very much recommended for HTPC's or any system that requires a smaller case, or less voltage.,Overclock settings can be viewed in the photos of this build"

I turned all other fans off in this system to be sure. It's louder than 3 other fans combined. This thing runs HOT. I dared not to OC it beyond 4ghz with the stock cooler. I've seen it reach over 80 degrees Celsius and that makes me very uncomfortable (lol). At its lowest it hasn't gone below 42 degrees. That being said, it will run League of Legends, even Tomb Raider. While the performance isn't perfect, it is still capable of achieving 60fps in 1080p (though it will vary greatly based on what type of games you play).,It was a decent option at time of purchase though now is easily outdone by Intel's Pentium line.,Decided to get this cpu mainly because it does pretty well for its price, and it's doing pretty well for me so far :D"

Expensive.,Amazing, I have so many things open without a problem....,Just check that you are receiving the correct one....

Overpriced. Especially when compared to Ryzen. But performance is still great and while overclocking on Broadwell-E isn't excellent, it still does OK. Managing 4.3GHz @ 1.275v. ,Freakin' awesome! Using After Effects and scrubing the timeline is always up to date. This CPU is so fast. Highly recommend.,It's a great CPU, don't get me wrong, but I can't believe I bought this for $1000 back in 2016.

With the CPU I wasn't looking for anything to heavy or expensive, the AMD FX-4350 works just fine for me and what I like to do. I do plan on upgrading to a better AMD CPU in the future but for now it works great. ,So far no complaints about this CPU. Not too loud, not too hot. My only disappointment is that it seems that this processor does not meet the minimum requirements for Battlefield 1, but whatever.,no problems here, after 2/3 years it is beginning to not play some games as well as i would like it to, but its still running strong,Really good price for 4 core but you pay for it as far as performance is concerned.  ,Good CPU for overall general tasks and light gaming. Usually maxes out on latest games like Battlefield Hardline and Star Wars Battlefront, so you might want to consider upgrading for future use.,I've been using this CPU ever since I got the system and it hasn't had any problems, except it used to run pretty hot until I recently got the Pure Rock Slim.,Fantastic processor, doesn't even hit 100% on doom and is very capable of overclocking, the stock cooler is not very good of course that is to be expected, but it is still certainly usable just a little loud.,I was CPU really surprised me. I didn't expect it to run games as well as it has. There is a lot of negativity regarding this little guy. But, so far it runs most games without bottlenecking with the GPU with the exception of the AAA games. Most people say it runs hot so I might consider getting a better heatsink in the future.,I am surprised that this CPU still can handle most modern games. It was easy to pick it out due to its price and performance. I rarely have problems with it being under full load even then it is only brief. The Stock CPU Cooler is a little too snug. Having tried to take the computer apart when I has moving things around. I tried to uninstall the CPU and it was pulled free from the socket by the Thermal paste being like glue. I was very worried but surprised again when I looked for anything wrong only to see all pins in place and not bent. I have not overclocked this CPU and I probably won't it is fast enough on it's own currently so no worries there. Just glad it can run Windows 10 and a GTX 1060 without any trouble.,Excellent CPU, I run it through some pretty strenuous tests and never had this CPU bottleneck or struggle. However, the stock cooler fan is mostly an expensive paperweight. I will use that for a cheap build (or as an emergency cpu fan while another one is on its way.)

Linux tends to run pretty fast, but there's a nice, very minor speed bump for AMD stuff (you can thank Intel's/MS's weird compilation of the Windows kernel; it favors Intel's compiler/flags over AMD). ,If you plan to play 2014 games and down with an overclock and a decent GPU, this should do fine, especially if used for $40 or $50 bucks. Modern games are playable with a high-end mid-range graphics card or a high-end, powerful GPU. I don't recommend building anything new with this - if you happen to come across an incredibly cheap build with this chip, or you're running an old system, you can still skate buy. With an OC it's about on par with a stock 2500k in terms of single-core performance and pulls slightly ahead with it's multicore (thanks to 6 physical cores). ,I bought this with am AM3+ board and honestly, other than the FX-8350, there's no point in upgrading. FX's single core was disappointing up until Vishera and only the ""8"" core model was worthy of upgrading to thanks to a noticeable bump in multicore and a minor bump in single core. New instructions and the ability to overclock the living hell out of it helped a lot, too.,I eventually upgraded to a 2700x and there are now no stutters with my games and things run significantly faster, but I still have a soft spot for my 1090t.

The processor was definitely worth the extra money for the X299 platform.,Pretty awesome. Unfortunately, it runs pretty hot, but it overclocks like a boss! Honestly, I would not change it out for the 8700k though due to the lack of pcie lanes. Not that I am using very many.,Suspect I might have over-specified this computer - since I've been unable to stress it at all.

Bought it and used it to play league while I saved up for a GPU and it did way better than I expected. Also I'm not sure if this is super bad or not but since I downloaded NZXT CAM I've been getting notifications every now and then (sometimes when I'm only browsing the web or watching youtube) saying that the cpu temp has exceeded 90C. So yeah I would probably suggest investing in a aftermarket cooler. (unless it is just CAM software being weird and unreliable, in which case ignore this lol),It hauls that's for sure :D.,Pros: I could not ask more of this chip. It is zippy, plays well with Ubuntu LTS as well as modern Windows iterations, games like a champ on default settings with the right RAM (2133 or 2400), DX12 support.,Cons:  would love to manually allocate RAM for GPU (this may be enabled on some motherboards but I am not aware); it appears to allocate 1/4 of 1/4 of your total RAM for the video card, meaning it scales by what it finds onboard. Again, using 1866 or lower RAM could cause less-than-ideal GPU performance.,Quick take: amazing budget/starter cpu, can't wait to see it in more builds!,Probably the best APU you can get. If you are not a gamer, this CPU will be more than enough with its R7 integrated graphic card.,I got it for $104 before taxes.,fast, works really well no issues but it does get hot,great APU. used it while I saved up for my GPU, and considering I mostly only play league, I was getting fairly decent fps (over 100 at highest settings) but found the stock cooler was so loud! (fine if you don't care about it being noisy) Never had any trouble with it, but make sure if you are using it as your only graphics that you get some high speed memory. (as your apu will use your memory as graphics memory),I bought this CPU originally for a Thermaltake Armor A30 SFF Case as I'd moved my i7 4790K out of the case due to heat issues so I figured this chip would be far coolers not having the grunt of the i7. It turns out I was wrong, not only did it run hotter but it has a much lower thermal margin meaning it downclocks a lot sooner than the 4th gen i7.,I then cut a 120mm hole in the side of the A30 case and fitted a AIO water cooler in push-pull config into the case which bought temps down but left no room for overclocking.,The motherboard also had issues recognising the APU even on the latest BIOS and wouldn't run turbo boost at all.,I finally gave up on the board and the case and got an Asus A88XM-Plus board and a Mid tower gaming case and upgraded the two AIO fans to noctua NF12's for as much performance as possible.,With that setup I was able to overclock the APU to 4.5Ghz safely and it does run well I don't think it's worth it over other options anymore."

If you're buying brand-new in 2018, for the love of god pick something newer. However, if you can get this thing used for around $45, it holds up remarkably well, but I'd still recommend (if you're dead-set for whatever reason on this particular chipset) that you bite the extra couple bucks and grab an 880K instead, which supposedly meets the minimum spec for VR gameplay, but this thing will still do you quite a bit of good in a budget gaming PC.,Powerful cpu. i got it to 4.1 on a hyper t2. Not good to buy new in 2017. just get a x4 950 if you want something cheap.,This is an amazing cpu! I paid only £45 for mine and for the price it was the best thing I could find at the time new. This cpu has served me well over these 4 years and have never once had an issue with it, this cpu is also great for overclocking as I have been running mine at 4.6Ghz for these past 3 years and it is still alive and kicking. Although sad to admit, this processor is starting to fall behind in games but this cpu still good enough to play games like the witcher 3 and fallout 4 (to name a few),If you can find this thing for around $50 it's a good deal. Sufficient enough to run most games decently. Don't plan to overclock with the stock cooler though. "

As a starter Gaming PC I am pleased with the performance.,Good processor is good. The cpu cooler (push pins) was a breeze to install.,So I'll admit, I ended up with this guy because I couldn't get my hands on a G4560 in a timely manner. I'm looking at it as paying $30 for a .2GHz overclock. I know, I know, a 6% performance boost for $30 is a small fraction of what that money could have gotten me in a better GPU, but I honestly doubt I'll ever take full advantage of the 1050 Ti as it is.,This is a great, affordable CPU. It works well in a low to mid range gaming computer. It would be great for a desktop computer as well. 
One downside is that Intel's Optane NVMe memory modules with super fast cache will not work with it. The sites often say that they require 7th generation chips (Kaby Lake chip), but the Intel site excludes Pentium chips with this technology. Get an i3 if you want to boost an HDD.
However, that is not a huge problem get a regular SSD if HDD load times bother you.,Wasn't the processor I was originally gonna buy.

My usual programs is Unity3D (Game Engine), Microsoft Visual Studio, GIMP and Chrome with several tabs.,Great CPU, if your looking for budget gaming or just a solid CPU this is your man,Great budget Chip,This cpu works great for most games and the hyper threading is a great bouns which gives you four threads. ,Good cpu for the money, dual core with hyper threading. Nice choice for those who can't splash out on the more expensive I5 or I7 cpu's,Great processor for mid-level gaming.  Hyper threading is extremely under estimated. I was surprised I can play GTA V, Titanfall 2, Warframe, Warhammer: Total War, Paladins, etc just fine and most of the those over 60 fps. For desktop usage  this is a very responsive chip that handles web browsing, spreadsheets, and multiple remote sessions just fine. I do plan to upgrade this to an i5 or i7 due to my video editing. This will render 1080p movie files just fine but were talking about 18 minutes for an 8 minute video.  ,Kinda slow and pricey. Would recommend an i5,Works great. Does everything I need it to!,It's a nice old CPU. It has a hard time multi-tasking at times and chugs along. I'm used to this though because I came from the Pentium 2020m. Overall it does mostly everything I need it to. It can game and create. It however isn't that good in Audacity. I don't know why it performs poorly in audacity.

Also, I was on a pretty tight budget. This was the perfect solution: it has hyperthreading and boosts up to 3,9 Ghz. IMO it's just an I7 without the integrated graphics. If you don't need the extra GHz's and you're planning on buying a GPU, this is the one I'd recommend.,Better than a i5 if you don't plan on overclocking for the same cost! whats not to like? ,Perfect for those people who don't need to overclock and don't want to spend as much money for similar performance. Great CPU deserves every star.,An I-7 for $100 less, and it has ECC support.  Great CPU if you don't want integrated graphics.,Best value 4C/8T chip hands down and will give overclocked i5 and i7's a run for their money. ,CPU: Incredible if you don't intend to overclock like me. For right now I'm just focusing on keeping everything frosty cool (hence Kraken X61). When deciding between this and an unlocked i5 it is really the tradeoff of overclocking vs hyperthreading. I went with hyperthreading and don't regret it for a second, I love my Xeon. Plus there's the added hype/originality/awesomeness factor that naturally comes with a Xeon.,i7 4770 without the iGPU.

It runs cool and is stable. For everyday use, the per clock core speed is lower and you won't notice any improvement is some tasks.  Some tasks may even appear to be slower.  It's awesome for video rendering, which is what I got it for. I would place it between the 6700K and the 6800K for video editing. If you got the cash, the 6800K (6 core) would be slightly better. If you really have cash, then the 6900K (8 core) will be considerably better. However, for a budget build, the 12 core 2658 is great. ,My other systems:,See my system build, Rainbow Unicorn, for benchmark info.,If you already have a 6700K, no need to upgrade to the Xeon  2658. However, if you haven't decided on your CPU yet, the Xeon 12 core is a solid choice. If you're using an ATX form factor, consider getting a dual-CPU motherboard for potentially expanding to 24 physical cores in the future.

This processor has just reached EOL so server farms are selling off these processors by the boatload, and they're unlocked so you can OC them on the appropriate motherboard.,One forewarning though: Because this is essentially a 3960X, even though the Intel ARK says it supports it, it doesn't go all the way up to PCI-E 3.0. You're stuck with PCI-E 2.0 bandwidth even though you have enough lanes. The higher end part, the V2 version of this processor which is the 4960X counterpart with PCI-E 3.0 support, is still an active part according to Intel ARK so prices won't come down on those for another year.,Also, the more slots you occupy or the denser the RAM you use, the difficulty of OCing goes up exponentially. You will require WAY more Vcore with 8 slots occupied compared to 4 or 2, but be VERY CAREFUL with VTT/IMC voltages and never exceed 1.2V or you will degrade your processor.,Otherwise, this is a great alternative to a i7 Extreme Edition processor that also supports ECC RAM."

Most software does not benefit much from running multiple cores and threads in parallel.  The G3470 is cheap, fast, and easy to cool.  Its per-thread performance is within 20% of Intel's top cpus costing  5x-10x more.,The $50 price was a brief email sale at Frys.,The Pentium G3470 has two cores of the same Haswell design as Intel's high end Core i7 series.  It uses 53 watts at 3.6GHz.   The Pentium has less L3 cache than the expensive Haswell chips, which can matter to running some programs with big data.   It  lacks hyperthreads, but multiple cores and multiple threads are generally useless for most workloads anyhow.   The included Intel graphics unit is good enough for non-gamer purposes.,Haswell gets about twice as much done per clock than Bay Trail cores, so G3470's speed is equivalent to about 7GHz for a Bay Trail core, ie 3 times faster than the best 10watt cpus.  ,The G3470 uses socket 1150, which gives maximum choices for motherboards, cpus, ram,  and coolers, with good price competition.  And by having a socket, rather than having the cpu soldered directly onto the motherboard (as with Atom and Bay Trail cpus),  you actually have all those choices. ,The retail version of G3470 comes with an Intel-designed all-aluminum down-blowing cpu cooler E97379 that works reasonably well given its size and weight.,Another fast cheap choice is the unlocked Pentium G3258, when mildly overclocked to 3.6Ghz or so.  It comes with Intel's higher-performing cpu cooler E97378 with copper core, that they normally ship  only on cpus running 75-100 watts.  ,A small step up from these, performance wise,  is the $140 Core i3-4370 with more cache and hyperthreads.  ,Intel 's quad-core i7-4790K cpu is 20% faster on single threads but its 88 watts requires more cooling and psu, a bigger case, and $350 just for the cpu itself."

A 4790k will understandably blow  this chip away but for what i do it serves me just fine.,Amazing CPU easy to force into constantly running at 3.9Ghz with Asus Z97M-Plus.

Got minor issues with BIOS and temps but latest drivers fixed them,At 199.99 this CPU is a great deal. It matches the Intel i7-9700K in single threaded performance, exceeds in multi-threaded performance, and does it all with less power and almost a $150 lower price tag (at the time of this writing). Yes, one could buy the 3600x or the 3700x for even more performance, yet the Ryzen 3600 seems to be adequate for the majority of gaming workloads. ,Happiness with purchase: 9/10 - Fantastic value. Kept my build price down significantly, and does everything I need. I sometimes wonder if I should have gone with a 2700X, though that would have inflated the build price.,Mine hits 4.1924 GHz, which is spot on for a 4.2 GHz box rating. Quite a nice step up from my R5 2600.,Lives up to the hype. There isn't much else to say about it., ,
This CPU has been reviewed by many reliable sources who go further in depth than I ever could but all I can say is that this CPU can tackle gaming, editing and rendering all at good temperatures.,Great CPU, however when I overclock I get worst performance then if I leave PBO and auto overclock on,For the cost, there is absolutely nothing I can say negative about it! One of the best cost to performance processors out there today!,Ryzen 5 is alive! Without any overclocking it seems ready, willing & able to tackle whatever comes its way.,Probably the best brand new budget cpu for gaming and productivity. A huge improvement over the i5 4570. 10/10 would buy again.,The price to performance on this chip is amazing. There's a reason it's coming in on the #1 'best overall' spot on a lot of CPU 2019 round up videos/reviews around the Internet. I do a mix of gaming and design work, and it never misses a beat.

I haven't noticed a difference in performance when gaming or using Handbrake though, only in synthetic benchmarks do I see a slight difference. Operating temps and voltages are still a little higher compared to previous Ryzen generations, though my idle temps have dropped a bit after the most recent BIOS updates. The included Wraith Prism cooler would probably do an okay job of cooling my chip but I don't care to try it when I already have a fairly decent aftermarket air cooler.,A very popular CPU at the moment and I can see why. It has a very decent price, performs amazingly. I could have gone with a 3600 but wanted this one for tasks aside from gaming.,Eight cores sixteen threads, overclockable, under 500 dollars, pretty decent ipc. Handles 1440p gaming and photo editing like butter in a hot toast.,Just built my first computer using this processor, and it is worlds faster than anything I've ever used.  I'm using it for video editing, and it lets me fly through the timeline.,Holy moly. Handles every game that I've tried and renders videos nearly three times as fast as my old i7-6700k. The motherboard originally gave it 1.45V at stock which was waaay too high for me, so I dropped it by 0.025V increments and checked the Cinebench R20 scores. See one of the last photos. I settled on 1.3V with no drawback to performance at stock clocks, which range from 3.6-4.3 GHz. I decided the all-core overclock wasn't really necessary and just let it do its own thing at stock clocks.,really nice for the price,Runs so well :),This thing is an absolute BEAST! It's not as hot as I thought it would be, performed really well in CPU benchmarks from 3Dmark, and I'd say this is the best CPU you can get on the market since it packs so much value at its price point.,This was my first AMD chip, and it certainly will not be my last!,Ryzen 3700X. Bought used, CPU only for a decent discount, as I already had a cooler in mind. With latest UEFI/BIOS, it's boosting at the rated 4.4GHz consistently. No point in overclocking 'X' variants fo Ryzen 3000 IMO. Beast of a CPU.,This processor is great for its price. €299 for an 8-Core 3.6 GHz processor is great if you compare it to its counterpart from Intel. The Core i7 9700K is priced at €399.

Feel free to let your beastly CPU handle itself :),Cheaper and best bang for the buck when it comes to price - performance. I went AMD over intel due to pricing. I got some of my parts of this build from Walmart since i have a discount with them so i save even more money from them. ,Got this for $280 total on Walmart after taxes and discount. Plus, i have sold the included wraith prism for 120mm aio for $50. So, it is like i got the cpu for $230.,I was originally going to get the R5 1600 but then I found out that the Zen+ cpu's were coming out in a months time so I decided to hold off for them, i'm happy with my choice of cpu here, even though I'll never use the full potential its nice to know I have it.,At $345 cdn I have no complaints.  Good enough for games and rendering is quite fast. ,Brilliant. Great stock cooler,The latest and greatest CPU uArch by AMD. Zen. Chosen for its thermal efficiency, very high performance, low cost compared to Intel solutions.,The AMD Ryzen 7 - 2700X is by far the best AMD CPU I have ever own, coming from an FX-8350 and FX-8370 systems, flexing its, true, eight cores and sixteen threads, it has been more than capable to handle everything I put it through, this being extreme workloads, intensive gaming session, and me learning how to overclock. Speaking of overclocking, earlier in my CPU’s life I was able to hit a stable 4.15 GHz overclock at 1.390 volts, but I stop there for the following reason. While it did score much higher in Cinebench than the stock frequency, the performance increase in game was small. At the stock clock frequency, my CPU runs at a consistent 4.0 GHz and will go as high as 4.5 GHz when under a load. Now, I will admit that Intel would've been a better choice for gaming, but my setup doubles as a workstation so I regret nothing. Not only that, but it is a huge improvement over the AMD FX-8350 and FX-8370 I had in my previous build.,Very impressed with this processor and for the most part the stock cooler as well. The cooler can get a little loud under heavy loads, but with the speakers up or headphones on, it doesn't really distract from gaming or work much.,Very happy with this product, wasn't sure if I want to give AMD a chance or go with Intel like always, but let me tell you, AMD is the bomb, if you are also undecided what to choose, think no more! This CPU slaughters Video editing and Gaming alike, even Internet Explorer works a bit faster on this."

I have successfully overclocked the CPU to 4.025 Ghz from 3.4Ghz and it is running stable.,What a great value chip! I love it. I think I also won the silicon lottery. Running stable at 4.2Ghz with 1.38V, ~40C idle and ~70C under loads. Further and longer duration testing required to determine absolute stability but stable right now. Running with a DR Pro4 cooler.,Two words - Great value. Pair it with most modern GPU's on most resolutions, and you'll have a good time gaming and if you wanted to - streaming with 6 cores and 12 threads. The good thing about going Ryzen at this point of time is that you have the ability to upgrade to Ryzen 3000, which is looking promising.,Great price to performance cpu. No problems with it so far,This processor is amazing at basically amazing at everything and overclocks really well.,Pros: ,Cons:,I'm giving this processor 4 out of 5 stars mainly due to the 2600x being the better value here.,The Ryzen 5 2600 is a great CPU, and i went with it because it was the best CPU for $160 that came with a stock cooler. The CPU works great but unfortunately I think I lost the silicon lottery because my benchmark scores are well below average. On stock settings I got around an 1100 on Cinebench and Userbenchmark put my CPU in the 20th percentile. So I decided to try some overclocking to see if I could get my scored a little higher. I downloaded Ryzen Master to test my overclocks before went into the bios, and this is where something strange is happening. On Ryzen Master I got my CPU to run stable at 3.9 GHz with 1.3v which gave me a 1343 score in Cinebench. However, when I go into the bios and change my core clockspeed and voltage to 3.9 GHz with 1.3v it doesn't really work. The bios apply the overclock and it shows it in task manager, but when I run Cinebench the clockspeed drops to 3.625 GHz and stays there. When I checked Ryzen Master to see what was going on I saw that the PPT(CPU), TDC (CPU), and EDC (CPU) all hit 100% and then the CPU underclocked itself. I tried dropping the overclock to 3.8 GHz and 3.7 GHz while also dropping the voltage, and the only combo that I could get it to not hit 100% was at 3.7 GHz with 1.2v. Now my Cinebench score is around a 1240 which is more inline with stock 2600's. If anyone knows what is going on and could help me I would appreciate it.,Hats off to AMD for this cpu man, so much performance from so little cost.
 I guess they needed to redeem themselves after the FX line so they made this wonderful cpu,The Ryzen 5 2600 is a great CPU for gaming for an excellent price.,Recommended by a friendly user on r/buildapc and overall I'm very pleased with it. Overclocked to 3.9GHz at 1.3V."

A couple of notes about Xeons; the E3 series is comparable to an i7 of the same generation (e.g. E3 V3 is Haswell, V2 is Ivy Bridge), none are unlocked for overclocking, and many of them don’t have an IGPU (nomenclature ending in 0 or 1). I point out the lack of IGPU for gamers that also record their sessions. Intel quick sync video requires the IGPU, and can be quite helpful for video encoding.,Affordable 'entry' CPU in terms of the 4-core, hyperthreaded (HT) realm, good for those needing multithreaded horsepower in a pinch.

Single-thread performance is among the best, but more applications are becoming multi-threaded, dx12 and spartan browser will better take advantage of multiple cores.,Also regarding the igpu, for a non-gamer it does the job, and for video scaling intel's dxva algorithm is the best, but newer drivers don't have 4k h264 decode which I am disappointed about.,There has been dual core bottleneck especially with a lot of applications and chrome tabs open, but nonetheless for the money it's not going to set the world on fire."

Lightning fast and overclocks LIKE A CHAMP!!! I honestly could not ask for anything better! I'm not a fanboy for Intel/AMD/Nvidia/etc.. but I am a GIANT fanboy when it comes to tech and this processor makes my inner fanboy nerdgasm daily lol,Absolutely love this beast! If you had told me last year that there would be a 10 core CPU that overclocks to 4.7Ghz like it's nothing I would have laughed at you! Here we are though and I could not be more happy with where technology is today! This is a very powerful CPU and while it is a little hot, it's nothing a delid can't solve! Well worth the money and I would recommend the 7900X looking for a good enthusiast processor!,For the hefty price tag you would hope this is a five star item.  I'll be honest. I read the reviews from other sites and when I hit the order button my heart sank.  I was coming from an i7 4790k and thought that the performance gain would be lackluster.  ,I was wrong, I was very, very wrong.  Holy god. This thing is a monster.  When I opened the box angels sang from above, the heaven's opened, Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit all ran to me and screamed ""I can't believe you bought this! It costs sooo much and no one needs it!"" While true, if you're looking to do a ludicrous build, this should be your cornerstone.  Overall, an excellent purchase, and something I would recommend doing at least once in your life if you have treat-yo-self money.,TL;DR: If you're even bothering to read this post, you should go ahead and buy it.  If you're looking for someone to tell you that you don't need it, and you will be happier with an i7 and won't regret not picking this one, you're going to need to look elsewhere.,For the price you better hope this is worth five stars.,This thing is a monster. Everyone said, ""I can't believe you bought this! It costs sooo much and no one needs it!""  But I do NOT regret buying this monster at all.,Wonderful CPU ! Temp is low with water cooling.. Could easily OC to 4.9 but stopped at 4.6 for now since I do not need the extra performance.   ,The cpu is fast but way too hot at the Intel boost settings. The 2 fan liquid cooler will not get the job done. Next week I will upgrade to a 360 radiator,Selecting the I9 7900 was the correct choice for me, well for gaming the most cores needed are 8 from what I researched. I9 was 10 and performance is great. A real Beast!! It was delidded and binned by Silicon Lottery @ 4.7GHz, Currently running at 4.3 GHz smoothly. Will raise the speed when I get a little more familiar with the new board.,Definitely gets hot when running on higher clocks. "

I really like the performance especially considering it can still be picked up new for around $160 at your local Microcenter from time to time.,Non-K. It was like $140 at MicroCenter, which was less than the 4460 I was originally planning to put in. If I pick up a 4960k on black friday or something, then I will get an NZXT Kraken CPU cooler for it.,Quite powerful and will handle most games +60FPS paired with a decent GPU and will handle VR. Although not as efficient as Skylake,This CPU is excellent and will last for quite some time as I found. The CPU is very fast for everyday tasks but not so much in some productivity programs. But still, on a  budget this CPU is a awesome choice.,Works great for the price and met all expectations. In hindsight, I should've gone for something with hyperthreading, but this works as advertised. ,Awesome little processor that can be found on the cheap side. Benchmarks well in today's games, but may start to show its age once games expand the 4 core mark. I would recommend this to anybody that is on their first gaming build.,4 cores and 4 threads with plenty of power for my needs. I picked a non overclocking chip for longevity purposes. This thing is blazing fast and has great thermals thanks to the refresh. I moved from a dual core celeron so you can only imagine the power difference,Beautifully efficient processor. The only reason I don't give it five stars is due to no overclocking potential.,Fantastic CPU, no complaints. MicroCenter (which has been mysteriously removed from PCPP as of late) had this for $159 and I got the motherboard bundled for an additional $20 off, which was a deal I couldn't refuse. In fact, most parts for this build were bought at Micro Center. ,The CPU blazes right through gaming, including games that could be classified as reasonably CPU-intensive. I haven't observed any GPU bottlenecks thus far, and of course it handles the everyday tasks such as YouTube and Skype well.,I'm docking a star for the stock cooler, which is a little subpar in my opinion. I understand it's just a stock cooler and not to expect too much of it, but still. I could barely hear any noise at all, while temps shot through the roof-but the fan was already on max speed. ,It's what you would expect. 4 cores, 4 threads, 3.3-3.5 Ghz. Not much else to say. ,Oh yeah it's the minimum spec for VR if I can ever afford that. "

It runs Windows fantastically, and I've found that Counter Strike Source, and Hawken run great on it. I've gotten Battlefield 3 to run on it, but being that Battlefield 3 is optimized for a quad core CPU, this dual core APU had a little trouble with sound and stutters.

Good integrated graphics. Perfect for a budget gaming pc,Pretty much what you'd expect from a dual-core, with the added bonus of an integrated GPU. Performance with the iGPU and dual graphics are great. I had some issues with stuttering, but was fixed by turning off Frame Pacing in the CCC. There was also Ubuntu (infinite restart loop issue), according to their forums it was the APU, either way I've since switched to Windows 8.1 and have had no problems. ,I ain't gon' lie y'all....

Currently there is no need for more performance for my LAN rig!,The 4460 has so far handled everything well, including some very light gaming without a GPU (20-30 fps on Heroes & Generals, nothing great). What I love most about this processor is that it runs cool. Even under load with my audio software (Reaper), I've never seen temps go above 45'C, and idle temps are a chilly 28-30'C on average. High temps are something we all want to avoid, but it's especially important in a home studio build where you don't want your fans ramping up and increasing noise levels. You could spend another $10-$15 for the extra 0.1 GHz gain of the i5-4590 if you wanted, but the tiny difference in performance would not be worth it in my opinion.,I'm quite pleased with the Intel 4460, working on it (CAD programs) is perfect, also light gaming. It wasn't a bad choice, had a good enough price/performence ratio.,It seems to work just fine - as a non-gamer, I was not interested in anything more spectacular, and it fitted my budget. The stock cooler seems very quiet and efficient - although I am comparing it with our old PC which sounded like the air-conditioning in a car being put on full blast.,Didn't plan on overclocking and i'm not into extreme editing so this was a clear and cost effective choice.,I was going to build a fairly cheap basic build based on the AMD FX-6350 but eventually decided on the Intel as i have the possibility to upgrade to an I7-4790K in the future. For the work I do this seems to be quick enough.,I needed i5 for the games I wanted to play, so I choose this. The main reason I picked the i5-4460 is because of the 0.2 GHz over the i5-4430 for just $10 more.,Serves me well.,Its only downside is that it struggles in cpu intensive open world games. The only game I play that's like that is black desert and I BARELY play it so this isn't anything crazy.,Good quad core CPU."

Go for Intel or upcoming Zen architecture. I feel life Bulldozer and its branches are irrelevant in 2016 unless your build is <$600.,I have yet to find a situation where this wasn't enough for me.

Wouldn't recommend getting it if it's much more than that, it was the best value for money at the time.,Great CPU. Enough cores to last me into the future. Doesn't bottleneck anything else in my system.,A veritable beast for the price I got it for. No issues with performance in any way so far. I had originally planned on keeping it at an overclock of around 4.5, but since AMD's Turbo Boost automatically brings it up to around 4.2 when needed I'll just hold off until/if I actually feel it needs it.,great middle ground between a FX6300 and an FX8350.  overclocks really nicely and it a great value.  I like Intel and AMD, AMD was chosen because it was have the price of a comparable intel core i5 that could be overclocked.,I almost regretted buying this, honestly. I was contemplating on why I didn't just go with the FX 6300 ($15 cheaper), while having some money left over to buy a better CPU cooler and overclock it to 6350 spec. Now I don't have any regrets. The CPU performance out of the box was very astonishing.,Pros:,-6 true cores @3.9Ghz Base, 4.2Ghz Boost,-Stock cooler kept it nice and cool even under load (<55°c),-One of the best budget CPU's for with great performance-per-dollar.,-Easily overclockable with the software tool AMD provides,Cons:,-6 core, 6 thread (Non multi-threaded),-The CPU fan is loud under load.,-CPU fan fitment issues on the Gigabyte GA-970A-D3P MB.

It's one of the best CPUs you can find under USD 60.00, if not the best. Although clock speeds aren't very high, its single thread performance is more than enough to satisfy office and domestic users, and the cores are strong enough to push an entry level GPU such as the GTX 750 Ti/R7 360 or even the GTX 950/RX 460 with little to no bottlenecks. Is also runs very cool, even with my cooler poorly mounted the CPU barely reached 70º C, and with the cooler properly installed it never surpassed 40º C, all this with the CPU cooler fan locked at 20%. Bottomline: amazing cost/benefit ratio, if you're in for something cheap and good, pick this one.,A good entry-level CPU that's perfect for basic builds, don't expect it to do so well with more demanding games though.,Great processor and the only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because the g4560 is the same price basically for better performance. :/ that's all,I'm very happy with it. Haven't had any problems with it so far, stock cooler keeps it at a decent 40 C on full load, and everything runs super fast. I've yet to render a video, but I will do that next week and update this review accordingly.,For basic computer use this CPU will work fine. I think that this is Intels most interesting budget CPU that they have released in years, mainly because of how cheap it is. Nearly half the cost of an i3 7100, yet still hast the same , but no hyper threading. It retailed at about $65 when it came out and I got it for $50. I could have went with the G4560 for around $35, (or g4600 for $30 more depending on availability) more than what I paid for the 4400, but I seen no use in having it hyper threaded for the price.,Fantastic! This little processor handles everything I've thrown at it. It's installed in my HTPC which doubles as a Plex server, and is on 24/7. Nothing seems to phase this little guy! I've ripped Blu-rays, compressed 30GB+ .mkv files to more reasonable ~2GB .mp4 files, and I've done some mild gaming on it. Paired with a GTX 750 Ti, I've been playing Fallout 3 at 1080p60 with all settings on ultra high, no hiccups at all. Considering the price you really can't go wrong with this little processor. Its low TDP makes it a great choice for a HTPC/Plex server too. It's certainly better suited for media playback than ripping and converting video files, but it can do it if you need it to. I really cannot say better things about the G4400, I've been very surprised and happy with its performance. Simply a great value.,for a dual core and non-hyperthreading processor,I'm not expecting too much but the good thing is , i can even Run GTA V at decent FPS on high settings and most new games from 2016 and some newly released game this year. but i suggest if you're gonna build a budget rig this year, go for G4560 kabylake , it's hyperthread processor and almost at the same price.,Only 2 threads, bottlenecks almost every game,This CPU works like a charm. Even if it's half a bill and sucks even next to a locked i5, Skylake is cool and efficient, and it will be more than enough for my dad for the next 3 years."

This is because some of the problems I have had have been rare and hard to find support for. Intel + the mobo manufacturers spend more time, resources, and visibility in supporting the mainstream market. The customer base for these HEDT chips is smaller and so support has just been more limited overall. That's why I would recommend, and personally will be, sticking to mainstream consumer parts in the future.,See my review of the ASRock X99E-ITX/ac mobo as well for additional details.,GOOD CPU -1 because of the price,As advertised.

Great CPU overall, no overclocking but performance has been more than sufficient. At some point I may upgrade to either the 8600k or 8700k.,perfect,So far an excellent processor. The 6 cores were worth it. Runs tabs, games, and windows with no hassle.,Can't give a performance based review on this just yet, but based on my research this was a good choice for the price point. We would get better multicore performance with an AMD equivalent but when I discussed this with my friend he wanted to focus on gaming rather than editing given the choice. ,My only frustration with this CPU is that it has made me realize how bad my timing was in building my own system. I originally planned on installing an i5-7600k or i7-7700k in place of my Pentium G4560. A few months later the Coffee Lake family came out. I know that the actual difference in performance from Kaby to Coffee lake won't be horribly noticeable for my daily use, but it drives me crazy that I will be spending $200-350 for an unlocked processor that is outperformed by locked processors that can be bought for $20-100 less. ,The chip is exactly what I ordered, so not much to review here.,I did opt for the non-K versions while pricing these out because I was not planning on overclocking, and wanted to see how I liked the stock CPU fans.  My review will be based solely on the included fan and instructions.,The Fan has factory applied thermal paste, which was in good clean condition and no additional thermal paste was needed.  The instructions left a bit to be desired, regardless to the fact that installation is relatively straight forward.  The only issue I ran into was the push clips were already turned in the LOCK position which made it difficult at first to push the clips into place.  Once I realized they were locked, it was easy enough to turn them, release the locking pins and push the clips into place.,The instructions have NO words for instructions, just a picture.  Again, this is getting picky because the installation is straight forward and easy."

It runs great at 4GHz. Although, if you are looking to buy this at MSRP I would recommend buying a i5 for a little more $$ and you'll get 6 cores,This i3 is as powerful as older i5s! It overclocks great, too. Was able to bump this to 5.0Ghz with no issues.,Not the greatest value new currently, nor the highest thread/core count. Definitely an amazing deal for the price I got it for though.,For an i3 CPU, this puppy actually manages to be very good overall. As a quad-core CPU with good overclocking capabilities (I've got mine set to 4.5Ghz at 1.27v), it's easily a match for the previous generation i5 chips, and much cheaper overall. The 8th gen i5 and i7 chips will likely be better for gaming, especially in the future, but at 1080p 60hz this CPU does just fine for even most modern AAA games.,Excellent price to performance ratio. Easily matches and outperforms the last gen chips in the I3 and I5 series. Runs fairly cool and overclocks well so far.,The little quad core that could. It's a good processor,I paid 156 for it brand new from eBay and have since seen them for as little as 132 dollars (USD),New 8th gen coffee lake doesnt disappoint. 4 Cores/4 threads at 4ghz out of the box outperforms the previous staple for gaming, the i5-7600k. Allows for overclocking, but downside is you have to buy a new 300 series mobo.,The 8350K really is a great CPU. Despite questionable pricing at release, at $135 there is no better bang for your buck for gaming when overclocked. You do need to spend an extra $20 to get a Z370/Z390 board, but it easily outperforms popular non-K i5 CPUs and hangs with my overclocked 8700K in most games. The i3 obviously falls behind in applications where hyperthreading matters, but there's not much incentive to buy up the stack if you're only gaming.,I mostly use my system in single threaded applications. I needed a processor where I could get the maximum CPU clock speeds.  The i3-8350K processor is ideal for my applications. I am able to over-
clock the 4 cores to 4.6GHz and have a very responsive system.  I deducted 1 star because of high
cost of the processor otherwise I would have given it 5 stars,Easy pick, and really good for its price and does not disappoint."

Personally, unless you are building a totally new system, I would suggest waiting for the next intel processors in the future.,Have to say I'm quite pleased so far. After a few hours of running GTA V i noticed a max CPU temp of 71. Dunno if that is too high or not. I have set the Q-Fan for the CPU and case fans on Turbo.

I don't overclock. Still very speedy! About a $100 cheaper than the low-end I7, but with about 80% of the processing speed. CPUBenchmark shows the Kaby Lake I5 7600 about 10% faster than the Skylake 6600. Most of that is probably attributable to the higher speed (3.5 GHz v 3.3). ,The stock fan is fine, but other fans appear to have more secure methods of mounting to the motherboard. You have to be careful to get the pins inserted and locked correctly. And since this was my first build in more than a decade, I didn't know that the stock cooler comes with wet thermal pasted pre-applied to the bottom of the heat sink. It's messy; be careful. ,Only marginally more expensive than the 7500 so I jumped for it. I'm not really qualified to give it a technical review, but so far so good on all fronts. The stock cooler comes with thermal paste already on there!,Nothing much. Just want to match with GPU for less bottleneck.,Excellent performance. Was tempted to wait for AMD Ryzen but given it's initial lack of I-GPU it would not have been suitable for HTPC (I didn't want to add a discrete GPU). ,@ 3.5ghz 4C/4T this CPU handles multiple VPC's and services fine.,Would have been nice to have the  i7 7700  but couldn't justify the extra $140 for minimal performance benefit."

I figured why not hit the upgrade cul-de-sac? Started with an A8-7600, but that's going into something much smaller. This A10 is noticeably more athletic but still not a lot to brag about. Fine choice for a designer novelty rig like this.,Amazing performance for an APU. Use with high frequency RAM.,This was my first, and in my opinion this is one tough processor with not bad graphics.  Truthfully I really like my AMD A10-7890K. It's Tops,This processor is truly amazing for the price. the graphics runs smoothly on GTA V. use high frequency ram because the integrated graphics use ram installed in the board.,Underclocked this to 3.0Ghz.
In my experience this clock does not affect the speediness of the general feel of this computer.
Lower temperatures were an added benefit.
This gives me room to overclock it in the future (Because I really want to slap a cooling block like it's a Hemi on a '69 Charger)
This APU is good enough for the everyday user and some.
Gaming on League at 60fps?
This can do 75-85fps on 1440p. (Average users are still slowly running 1080p monitor.)
This was run with 2 Acer 1440 60hz monitors.
Take note that the ram needed to be overclocked to 2133 to achieve these results and I did not change any volt settings to do this.
I think I can up the ram to 2400 but I would have to up the voltage to the ram to 1.6v (Stock is sitting at 1.5v)
This can run OBS and record videos albiet you will need to lower settings to 1080p and on 30fps. You can probably run this in 60fps recording with another ""low-profile"" r7 250 which I am still waiting to receive.,Overall this CPU is more than enough to last a few years.
I'd put my money on 5 years or more depending on the user.,This build gets cheaper everyday, and worth more than spending $500 bucks on a console. This can run emulators as well.,A good APU but sadly mine is not much of an overclocker. I can only get a stable 4.3GHz overclock.,Absolute monster of an APU. Great path for upgrades in the future. I'd recommend either an RX 470, a GTX 1060, or what I will do, an RX 480.

Runs hot just like any other AMD. GPU is squarely in the ""not bad"" category and still some of the best you can get onboard without spending a small fortune on top end Core i7 with IrisPro. The onboard GPU is its big sell so don't mess with the APU series unless you are specifically avoiding discrete video or don't have room for it...or you got one for free ;-)  Would probably not purchase one again, opting instead for a bigger box with discrete GPU. Very niche.,Overall, great little APU. It's no performance king vs it's AM3+ bothers or intels cpu's but it will allow you to play your games and work on other productivity task at need.,Pros: 
1. It's overall fast for most needs with 4 cores for your needs. (It matches my stock Core i7 920 in most tasks.),This APU also allows you to build a compact system without a gpu or allows you to have some graphics in your system for now and to be able to save your money for a dedicated gpu down the road.,Also useful for keeping temps under control if your using a cooler that cant perform under the cpu's full load.,And I think this Apu could go farther if it was on a better motherboard but im limited to ITX motherboards in my case. ,Although I do have a con about the overclocking.,Cons:,Unless you adjust the TDP target or have a good cpu cooler, be prepared for the stock cooler to be running like a jet when you have any load on it. ,If you have both gpu and cpu sides of the apu @ 100% loaded, the cpu will downclock itself (i've seen it go as low as 3GHz). This issue only disappears when the gpu is not loaded.  ,They report the temperature in Thermal Margin. As in, How much overhead you have till you hit the max temp. So big numbers like 70c is really good. Small numbers like 5 or 10c is really bad.,To monitor temps, You'll need to use AMD overdrive software. ,Becoming a fan. If you are thinking about an i3, think about this one instead. ,This APU is a beast! Stays quiet even under load (until you add a dedicated GPU, MSI R9 380 4GB in my case, which runs quiet but really heats up the APU because it sits so close to it. You can add a liquid cooler to get rid of that problem). It can handle many games at 1080p. Games such as GTA5, FarCry 3, Saints Row IV and the like run in console quality and sometimes better.,Decently fast cpu, good onboard graphics.,Don't build a system with an APU for over $350. Its not worth. Works great tho!,Fine for what it is.,
Not going to be equal to a good CPU + GPU set-up for games.,
Has powered my Linux PC with no problems at all.,Great for entry level pc. not so good for high end gaming. I will say its a good overclocker, I got my chip to 4.4 ghz stable but that may vary from chip to chip. best left to apu builds,This chip is amazing! It plays every game I have. Not at the best settings (obviously) but at acceptional ones.,I currently have this overclocked to 4.4 on the CPU and 960 on the GPU. Running stable so far, no issues. As long as you spring for decent ram, 2133 speed or better, you will get a good response from this chip.,Very much recommended for HTPC's or any system that requires a smaller case, or less voltage.,Overclock settings can be viewed in the photos of this build"

I turned all other fans off in this system to be sure. It's louder than 3 other fans combined. This thing runs HOT. I dared not to OC it beyond 4ghz with the stock cooler. I've seen it reach over 80 degrees Celsius and that makes me very uncomfortable (lol). At its lowest it hasn't gone below 42 degrees. That being said, it will run League of Legends, even Tomb Raider. While the performance isn't perfect, it is still capable of achieving 60fps in 1080p (though it will vary greatly based on what type of games you play).,It was a decent option at time of purchase though now is easily outdone by Intel's Pentium line.,Decided to get this cpu mainly because it does pretty well for its price, and it's doing pretty well for me so far :D"

Overpriced. Especially when compared to Ryzen. But performance is still great and while overclocking on Broadwell-E isn't excellent, it still does OK. Managing 4.3GHz @ 1.275v. ,Freakin' awesome! Using After Effects and scrubing the timeline is always up to date. This CPU is so fast. Highly recommend.,It's a great CPU, don't get me wrong, but I can't believe I bought this for $1000 back in 2016.

With the CPU I wasn't looking for anything to heavy or expensive, the AMD FX-4350 works just fine for me and what I like to do. I do plan on upgrading to a better AMD CPU in the future but for now it works great. ,So far no complaints about this CPU. Not too loud, not too hot. My only disappointment is that it seems that this processor does not meet the minimum requirements for Battlefield 1, but whatever.,no problems here, after 2/3 years it is beginning to not play some games as well as i would like it to, but its still running strong,Really good price for 4 core but you pay for it as far as performance is concerned.  ,Good CPU for overall general tasks and light gaming. Usually maxes out on latest games like Battlefield Hardline and Star Wars Battlefront, so you might want to consider upgrading for future use.,I've been using this CPU ever since I got the system and it hasn't had any problems, except it used to run pretty hot until I recently got the Pure Rock Slim.,Fantastic processor, doesn't even hit 100% on doom and is very capable of overclocking, the stock cooler is not very good of course that is to be expected, but it is still certainly usable just a little loud.,I was CPU really surprised me. I didn't expect it to run games as well as it has. There is a lot of negativity regarding this little guy. But, so far it runs most games without bottlenecking with the GPU with the exception of the AAA games. Most people say it runs hot so I might consider getting a better heatsink in the future.,I am surprised that this CPU still can handle most modern games. It was easy to pick it out due to its price and performance. I rarely have problems with it being under full load even then it is only brief. The Stock CPU Cooler is a little too snug. Having tried to take the computer apart when I has moving things around. I tried to uninstall the CPU and it was pulled free from the socket by the Thermal paste being like glue. I was very worried but surprised again when I looked for anything wrong only to see all pins in place and not bent. I have not overclocked this CPU and I probably won't it is fast enough on it's own currently so no worries there. Just glad it can run Windows 10 and a GTX 1060 without any trouble.,Excellent CPU, I run it through some pretty strenuous tests and never had this CPU bottleneck or struggle. However, the stock cooler fan is mostly an expensive paperweight. I will use that for a cheap build (or as an emergency cpu fan while another one is on its way.)

At the time, it ran everything without issue. I was able to OC it to about 3.8GHz and to 3.9GHz with some instability and heat issues. 3.8GHz is definitely the sweet spot with a nice NB bump in MHz and voltage helping too. Paired with an HD6950, it ran pretty much everything up until about 2016. DOOM and Fallout 4 were suffering, so I upgraded to an RX 580. With an RX 580, the OC'd 3.8GHz Phenom II 1090t did very well. I did still get some stutters, but not as many as before. It stayed reasonably cool at about 65 - 70C with the EVO 212 Plus by Cooler Master. ,At the time, I was playing Max Payne, Max Payne II, Skyrim, Oblivion, Doom 3, Halo, Halo 2, World of Warcraft and Minecraft. All of those ran very well on it without problems. I never really played anything at stock clocks, so I couldn't really say much about that. ,Booting into Linux and running an Ubuntu based system, or straight-up Debian, ran wonderfully. Linux tends to run pretty fast, but there's a nice, very minor speed bump for AMD stuff (you can thank Intel's/MS's weird compilation of the Windows kernel; it favors Intel's compiler/flags over AMD). ,If you plan to play 2014 games and down with an overclock and a decent GPU, this should do fine, especially if used for $40 or $50 bucks. Modern games are playable with a high-end mid-range graphics card or a high-end, powerful GPU. I don't recommend building anything new with this - if you happen to come across an incredibly cheap build with this chip, or you're running an old system, you can still skate buy. With an OC it's about on par with a stock 2500k in terms of single-core performance and pulls slightly ahead with it's multicore (thanks to 6 physical cores). ,I bought this with am AM3+ board and honestly, other than the FX-8350, there's no point in upgrading. FX's single core was disappointing up until Vishera and only the ""8"" core model was worthy of upgrading to thanks to a noticeable bump in multicore and a minor bump in single core. New instructions and the ability to overclock the living hell out of it helped a lot, too.,I eventually upgraded to a 2700x and there are now no stutters with my games and things run significantly faster, but I still have a soft spot for my 1090t.

This is one of the better chips. ,In my particular build, was able to overclock to 4.8 Ghz at 1.464 volts and thermal is holding at 34 C idle and 52 C load. I would argue it's a better deal then going with the FX-9590. ,So far I am very pleased with this processor.  It has some bog shoes to fill, as I loved the 6300 I had before it.  I have not done any overclocking yet, but if I see some good results, I may bump it up to 5 stars. ,Nice, stable performance with no real hiccups.

I have not had any problems with the processor overheating since I bought it, and doubt that I will have any problems with it for a long time. The processor was definitely worth the extra money for the X299 platform.,Pretty awesome. Unfortunately, it runs pretty hot, but it overclocks like a boss! Honestly, I would not change it out for the 8700k though due to the lack of pcie lanes. Not that I am using very many.,Suspect I might have over-specified this computer - since I've been unable to stress it at all.  All the games I've got play at max resolution with no problems, and without causing the CPU any temperature problems at all - though some of that may be down to the awesome Kraken AIO cooler below!,Beast of a processor, very stable and easy to overclock.

(as your apu will use your memory as graphics memory),I bought this CPU originally for a Thermaltake Armor A30 SFF Case as I'd moved my i7 4790K out of the case due to heat issues so I figured this chip would be far coolers not having the grunt of the i7. It turns out I was wrong, not only did it run hotter but it has a much lower thermal margin meaning it downclocks a lot sooner than the 4th gen i7.,I then cut a 120mm hole in the side of the A30 case and fitted a AIO water cooler in push-pull config into the case which bought temps down but left no room for overclocking.,The motherboard also had issues recognising the APU even on the latest BIOS and wouldn't run turbo boost at all.,I finally gave up on the board and the case and got an Asus A88XM-Plus board and a Mid tower gaming case and upgraded the two AIO fans to noctua NF12's for as much performance as possible.,With that setup I was able to overclock the APU to 4.5Ghz safely and it does run well I don't think it's worth it over other options anymore."

If you're buying brand-new in 2018, for the love of god pick something newer. However, if you can get this thing used for around $45, it holds up remarkably well, but I'd still recommend (if you're dead-set for whatever reason on this particular chipset) that you bite the extra couple bucks and grab an 880K instead, which supposedly meets the minimum spec for VR gameplay, but this thing will still do you quite a bit of good in a budget gaming PC.,Powerful cpu. i got it to 4.1 on a hyper t2. Not good to buy new in 2017. just get a x4 950 if you want something cheap.,This is an amazing cpu! I paid only £45 for mine and for the price it was the best thing I could find at the time new. This cpu has served me well over these 4 years and have never once had an issue with it, this cpu is also great for overclocking as I have been running mine at 4.6Ghz for these past 3 years and it is still alive and kicking. Although sad to admit, this processor is starting to fall behind in games but this cpu still good enough to play games like the witcher 3 and fallout 4 (to name a few),If you can find this thing for around $50 it's a good deal. Sufficient enough to run most games decently. Don't plan to overclock with the stock cooler though. "

As a starter Gaming PC I am pleased with the performance.,Good processor is good. The cpu cooler (push pins) was a breeze to install.,So I'll admit, I ended up with this guy because I couldn't get my hands on a G4560 in a timely manner. I'm looking at it as paying $30 for a .2GHz overclock. I know, I know, a 6% performance boost for $30 is a small fraction of what that money could have gotten me in a better GPU, but I honestly doubt I'll ever take full advantage of the 1050 Ti as it is.,This is a great, affordable CPU. It works well in a low to mid range gaming computer. It would be great for a desktop computer as well. 
One downside is that Intel's Optane NVMe memory modules with super fast cache will not work with it. The sites often say that they require 7th generation chips (Kaby Lake chip), but the Intel site excludes Pentium chips with this technology. Get an i3 if you want to boost an HDD.
However, that is not a huge problem get a regular SSD if HDD load times bother you.,Wasn't the processor I was originally gonna buy. But I'm happy with it so far does what I need it to do,This CPU is amazing for what it has. It certainly isn't the best and doesn't score very high but it does its job perfectly."

My usual programs is Unity3D (Game Engine), Microsoft Visual Studio, GIMP and Chrome with several tabs.,Great CPU, if your looking for budget gaming or just a solid CPU this is your man,Great budget Chip,This cpu works great for most games and the hyper threading is a great bouns which gives you four threads. ,Good cpu for the money, dual core with hyper threading. Nice choice for those who can't splash out on the more expensive I5 or I7 cpu's,Great processor for mid-level gaming.  Hyper threading is extremely under estimated. I was surprised I can play GTA V, Titanfall 2, Warframe, Warhammer: Total War, Paladins, etc just fine and most of the those over 60 fps. For desktop usage  this is a very responsive chip that handles web browsing, spreadsheets, and multiple remote sessions just fine. I do plan to upgrade this to an i5 or i7 due to my video editing. This will render 1080p movie files just fine but were talking about 18 minutes for an 8 minute video.  ,Kinda slow and pricey. Would recommend an i5,Works great. Does everything I need it to!,It's a nice old CPU. It has a hard time multi-tasking at times and chugs along. I'm used to this though because I came from the Pentium 2020m. Overall it does mostly everything I need it to. It can game and create. It however isn't that good in Audacity. I don't know why it performs poorly in audacity. Maybe it doesn't utilize the hyper-threading. Idk. It's maybe not good for its price anymore. "

Runs cool under a good cooler.,Abslolutely awesome CPU. I had a really hard time choosing between a locked I7 with hyperthreading and a unlocked I5 without hyperthreading. Also, I was on a pretty tight budget. This was the perfect solution: it has hyperthreading and boosts up to 3,9 Ghz. IMO it's just an I7 without the integrated graphics. If you don't need the extra GHz's and you're planning on buying a GPU, this is the one I'd recommend.,Better than a i5 if you don't plan on overclocking for the same cost! whats not to like? ,Perfect for those people who don't need to overclock and don't want to spend as much money for similar performance. Great CPU deserves every star.,An I-7 for $100 less, and it has ECC support.  Great CPU if you don't want integrated graphics.,Best value 4C/8T chip hands down and will give overclocked i5 and i7's a run for their money. ,CPU: Incredible if you don't intend to overclock like me. For right now I'm just focusing on keeping everything frosty cool (hence Kraken X61). When deciding between this and an unlocked i5 it is really the tradeoff of overclocking vs hyperthreading. I went with hyperthreading and don't regret it for a second, I love my Xeon. Plus there's the added hype/originality/awesomeness factor that naturally comes with a Xeon.,i7 4770 without the iGPU.

I use this in my NAS and it can transcode videos just fine.
With this i3, I was able to transcode 3 concurrent videos down to 2Mbps in Plex.,The on board GPU is more than capable of playing back HD content but I don't really use it for that.,I don't mind the performance of the thing it's pretty good.. for now maybe I might go for more ""cpu-intensive"" games later on.."

It runs cool and is stable. For everyday use, the per clock core speed is lower and you won't notice any improvement is some tasks.  Some tasks may even appear to be slower.  It's awesome for video rendering, which is what I got it for. I would place it between the 6700K and the 6800K for video editing. If you got the cash, the 6800K (6 core) would be slightly better. If you really have cash, then the 6900K (8 core) will be considerably better. However, for a budget build, the 12 core 2658 is great. ,My other systems:,See my system build, Rainbow Unicorn, for benchmark info.,If you already have a 6700K, no need to upgrade to the Xeon  2658. However, if you haven't decided on your CPU yet, the Xeon 12 core is a solid choice. If you're using an ATX form factor, consider getting a dual-CPU motherboard for potentially expanding to 24 physical cores in the future. It's a ton of fun to use.,I have a small 3% overclock on the Xeon by adjusting the base clock up and it's stable."

This processor has just reached EOL so server farms are selling off these processors by the boatload, and they're unlocked so you can OC them on the appropriate motherboard.,One forewarning though: Because this is essentially a 3960X, even though the Intel ARK says it supports it, it doesn't go all the way up to PCI-E 3.0. You're stuck with PCI-E 2.0 bandwidth even though you have enough lanes. The higher end part, the V2 version of this processor which is the 4960X counterpart with PCI-E 3.0 support, is still an active part according to Intel ARK so prices won't come down on those for another year.,Also, the more slots you occupy or the denser the RAM you use, the difficulty of OCing goes up exponentially. You will require WAY more Vcore with 8 slots occupied compared to 4 or 2, but be VERY CAREFUL with VTT/IMC voltages and never exceed 1.2V or you will degrade your processor.,Otherwise, this is a great alternative to a i7 Extreme Edition processor that also supports ECC RAM."

Most software does not benefit much from running multiple cores and threads in parallel.  The G3470 is cheap, fast, and easy to cool.  Its per-thread performance is within 20% of Intel's top cpus costing  5x-10x more.,The $50 price was a brief email sale at Frys.,The Pentium G3470 has two cores of the same Haswell design as Intel's high end Core i7 series.  It uses 53 watts at 3.6GHz.   The Pentium has less L3 cache than the expensive Haswell chips, which can matter to running some programs with big data.   It  lacks hyperthreads, but multiple cores and multiple threads are generally useless for most workloads anyhow.   The included Intel graphics unit is good enough for non-gamer purposes.,Haswell gets about twice as much done per clock than Bay Trail cores, so G3470's speed is equivalent to about 7GHz for a Bay Trail core, ie 3 times faster than the best 10watt cpus.  ,The G3470 uses socket 1150, which gives maximum choices for motherboards, cpus, ram,  and coolers, with good price competition.  And by having a socket, rather than having the cpu soldered directly onto the motherboard (as with Atom and Bay Trail cpus),  you actually have all those choices. ,The retail version of G3470 comes with an Intel-designed all-aluminum down-blowing cpu cooler E97379 that works reasonably well given its size and weight.,Another fast cheap choice is the unlocked Pentium G3258, when mildly overclocked to 3.6Ghz or so.  It comes with Intel's higher-performing cpu cooler E97378 with copper core, that they normally ship  only on cpus running 75-100 watts.  ,A small step up from these, performance wise,  is the $140 Core i3-4370 with more cache and hyperthreads.  ,Intel 's quad-core i7-4790K cpu is 20% faster on single threads but its 88 watts requires more cooling and psu, a bigger case, and $350 just for the cpu itself."

A 4790k will understandably blow  this chip away but for what i do it serves me just fine.,Amazing CPU easy to force into constantly running at 3.9Ghz with Asus Z97M-Plus.

I was far too green to attempt any overclocking when I was using this chip in my main rig, but holy crap you can really crank this thing up! With a normal tower fan I got somewhat stable 3.8GHz, but the temps weren't great- so we settled for 3.4Ghz which is a modest 20% OC. With AIO or liquid cooling I'm sure that you could achieve even better results. ,Good for the price (Ali Express). Only used for older games (GTA III, VC, SA) and emulation.

I had been watching it for some time, just due to the specs and was able to snag one at a great price so I couldn't pass it up.  It was flagged as incompatible with my MOBO but everything works fine.  The boot times are between 5 and 7 seconds consistently (prior to fan switch they would be between 5 and 40 sec, with 30 to 40 seconds being most common, so not exactly sure how a case fan and CPU cooler orientation switch changed that?), and the speed usually sits right at 3.5GHz according to task manager, sometimes higher, sometimes lower.,My power draw for the entire system idles at 32watts, how can you not love that?!

Keeps up pretty well, but does bottleneck an RX 470.,Any intel is Great! Worked perfectly, like it should.,Fantastic CPU. Runs very well as keeps up well with everything I do. To be honest however, I wish I would have bought an i5 ""K"" processor for just around $50 more. This one is great, and has very nice clock speeds but is only 2 cores, and having 4 (not hyper threaded) would really help. Also, it cannot be overclocked so overall I probably should have spent the little extra money and got the i5. This one is great, don't get me wrong but the i5 would have been better, and just convert it from ""good"" to ""great""."

Even if it's a bit old now, especially with the new Extreme CPUs from Intel right around the corner, it does the job amazingly well ! The 12 threads are not really useful in game, that's why I overclocked it. I luckily hit a stable 4.7GHz, with decent temperatures.
The main reason why I got this CPU was not to have an overkill one (well, maybe a bit), but because of its number of lanes. As I wanted a SLI and a M.2 SSD, a normal desktop CPU wouln't have fit.,I went with the 5820k over the 5930k simply because there's no big difference between the two other than the clock speed. Right now it's feeling a little faster rendering videos with the extra cores. I do plan on overclocking it to maybe 4ghz? Just trying to squeeze a little bit more juice out of it.,  .. Well .. Honestly, not sure if I have to speak on behalf of this Chip.. It speaks Volumes on its OWN. This chip Tears through Anything you can toss at it. It has had NO Issues with any true day to day work loads.

I'm probably not going to overclock it, for now.,I have enjoyed this processor very much. I was able to overclock mine to 4.6Ghz I did reach 4.7Ghz but even though it passed its stress test it had some other issue later on. I bet if I adjusted the voltages a little more I can get a stable 4.7.,Not bad considering Skylake is shooting for around 4.8Ghz from what I've seen so far.  ,Hands down best price-to-performance ratio for the high-end CPU's available right now.

The G4560 is basically an i3 but at $50-$110 less. This CPU made not only the entire i3 line up obsolete but also made the $120 gap to the i5's difficult to justify for budget gamers. With the release of AMD's Ryzen R5 CPUs later this year, I expect the i3's and i5's to become even more obsolete if Intel doesn't do some major price cuts.,I can't say enough good things about this little CPU.

My very first computer, a Windows 98 AMD Compaq Presario, STILL works.  ,So far this is the best CPU I've had. It's fast enough for what I do, gaming mostly. So far the only thing I can say that is negative is that it is a FURNACE, but even then, I haven't needed a space heater during the last couple of winters.,Absolute power hungry CPU, does the job but you have to have the money for it...,8 cores of factory overclocked heat producing goodness. Kills any game I throw at it even with today's AAA titles. Boost to 5Ghz when needed.,Very capable processor. Best bang for the buck performance. I purchased it for $180 at microcenter and could not be happier. It has a reputation for being a space heater, but I have not had any issues with it.

Was looking for a CPU that could perform well today and be future proofed for the next few years. Kabylake 4 core was a bit underwhelming, and the X99 intel chips were overpriced. Ryzen offered great performance / cores per dollar, at the expense of some early adopter issues.,Pros: ,
1) 8 cores for much less than the equivalent Intel CPU!,Cons: ,
1) Overclocking on the 1800X should be far better than the 1700X and 1700 but isn't. Also overclocking maxes out with the CPU running at ~55'C, well within any thermal limit. ,
2) The 20'C offset on CPU temperatures is annoying when designing a quiet system (PWM uses the CPU temperature as a control point, and the PWM % maxes out at CPU of 80'C, which is only 60'C for Ryzen). ,
3) Overall early adopter teething issues / AMD rushing the product out,Not yet fully optimized for gaming as many know, but this will improve in time as developers and manufacturers have more time with the architecture. It will serve my needs for quite a while though.,Great cpu so far,I cannot recommend this enough.. Even without overclocking, the1800x was well over 2x faster than my 5930k in a volumetric rendering test.. It is just incredible!!!,Great CPU does 4.0ghz on stock voltage almost twice the cinebench score than my previous CPU (6700k) with no appreciable difference in gaming performance for what I play. ,I was skeptical about going for the most expensive Ryzen 7 chip, but I figured why not, if you build it, they will come. This processor is fast! My previous build was an A8 6600k, going from that to this, is a huge step. The speed is amazing, I can do everything I need at once and not a single issue with speed comes up.  Paired with an AIO cooler, it never gets that hot. At peak with a load I hit about 60 degrees max.,Super fast and I have no complaints.,Rock solid for its price and performance. I read that it can be difficult getting it about 4ghz, didn't have a problem with the Asus software getting it to 4.1ghz and allowing me to bench away.,Intel hasn't made a processor worth upgrading to in 3 years and their next 15% improved  4 core chip won't be something I will invest in either. I use Xeon based blade servers at my job and it involves compile operating systems a lot and  when I wanted to learn anything at home my i7 4790k would take forever to compile. The 1800x has cut down the time by almost half! All the Intel mainstream processors like the 7700k get manhandled by the 1800x.,For gaming my performance improved since I always play with 10 chrome tabs, Twitch, Spotify and a couple other things running with my game, also I get much better lows since the cpu isn't pegged at 100% which forced the scheduler to juggle more than it can handle.,So good and so bloody fast. Worth every single penny and once tuned correctly with the rest of components, can be just as good as an 7700k in gaming and an 6900K in rendering. Now I'm just waiting for Vega."

There was no reason for a 6600k and the differences in the 6500/6400 are so negligible that it wasn't worth the $50 additional cost at the time.

While it may not have quite as good of a bang for your buck option as its older sibling, the little brother of the 6500 is still a very capable quad core locked CPU, with solid clock speeds, and no hints of bottlenecking with the likes of the GTX 1060 or RX480.,For my gaming needs it runs great, low TDP, low core temperatures, and hasn't given me any issues so far.  Not as powerful or as overclockable as it's -K brethren but certainly gets the job done in cool fashion.  Bang for buck I give it 4 stars since it's a great little CPU, but loses a star since Intel have been keeping overclockers from unlocking the potential of the chip.   ,very good bang for your buck. cpu itself is very powerful compared to anything I had before and has similar performance toa an i7 3840qm. also, the igpu is surprisingly capable and can handle some light games at 1080p"

I am not that serious of a gamer. I spend a lot more time in front of my machine performing non-gaming tasks, and dollar for dollar AMD has always bested Intel in non-gaming performance IMHO. I have been excited about the Threadrippers since I first saw the 1900x. But I held off on building one because the 9590 was so strong for me. $800 US was a bit more than I would have normally cared to spend on a CPU. My original parts list for this build contained a Ryzen 7 2700X. But when I saw where the total build was coming in at price-wise, and it was well under-budget, I decided to splurge a bit. Glad I did, too. This thing is incredible. I would like to have acquired a 2990WX, but my I am not swinging it like that in the bank account! I have read where some people were passive-cooling this chip, but I am of the opinion that if you spend this much on a CPU, and the price of closed loop coolers being not terribly high, you water cool it and that's that. AMD chips have notoriously run hot anyway, so why chance it?,Installation was ok, if you forgive the multiple RMA (see below). TR4 is different than other chips, as you don’t just plunk the chip into the socket, slap a heatsink on and be done. You have to slide the chip into a swinging latch, then fasten it down to the socket. Apparently, there was a big to-do over the mount points for these chips being vastly different than other chips (even AMD chips), that mobo manufacturers were having some trouble fitting them. AMD provides a bracket that should alleviate most concerns about this.,The packaging was.....visually impressive, if not completely unnecessary. Retail ships in a box roughly the same dimensions of a women's shoebox. And all kinds of molded plastic that seems to be intended to ""sell the sizzle"". I couldn't help but wonder if they could ratchet down the packaging, and charge $700 instead. But at this price point, maybe it does not matter. To AMD's credit, the packaging offers plenty of protection, so maybe it's worth the extra dough to protect your investment during shipping.,Performance was exactly what you would expect. BLAZING! I will post benchmarks at a later date, but they will not disappoint, I promise. And it's a bit of an ego boost to see 32 threads in a workstation. Pretty neat."

Absolutely flawless processor. ,At $269 (Paired with a Mobo at Microcenter) for a 8Core/16Thread monster of a CPU, its an amazing value of a CPU. Great with routine tasks, mining, virtual machines, and on synthetic benchmarks. If I do have any gripes, Its that it get pretty hot when pushing towards 4GHz OC with 1.37 V. But that's the case limiting the amount of cooling that I can throw at he CPU. Overall, an amazing value, and a strong performer.,Runs like a dream. 8 Cores and can overclock very easily. Got it to run fine at 3.9ghz may go higher later on.,So far I've had a great experience with my 1700x. Upgraded from an aging FX8320 that served me well. I gained a lot of performance across the board from games to editing/rendering. The FX8320 did well but I finally feel like I have Intel-level performance in games while still keeping the productivity potential of an 8core CPU from an AMD chip.,I haven't had any issues with compatibility or anything with my MSi b350 tomahawk board either. I've had the whole setup for a month now - OC'd to 3.9ghz since day 1. Sure the 1700 can be manually overclocked and comes with a cooler and can match the 1700x - but I'm enjoying utilizing AMD's OC utilities the X offers. It's neat - I'm not too upset about the little more I spent.,Runs fast and cool! 8 cores! Apparently the X on the 1700 just means it's clocked a bit faster, but it was only $20 more than the 1700 and I don't want to mess with overclocking. ,Team Red!,Premiere Pro is absolutely screamingly fast with this thing. Now all other computers seem inadequate.,Bought it for only 150 bucks during Black Friday, which is a crazy good deal. Managed to get my chip to 4GHz at only 1.35V (stock voltage) stable. Tried going to 4.1 but it wouldn't budge, but it's all good. 4GHz at stock voltage for only $150. I really won the silicon lottery.,Works Great!

Happy with the performance overall. ,Certainly a nice CPU, but on reflection the value vs performance sweet spot is probably with the i5-7500,Good cpu
only downside is not much inprove from the skylake to kabylake ( i5 6400),Good for all type of gaming but still slow for encoding and editing. Sufficient cores and threads for actual gaming but don´t expect anything beyond that.,The i5-7400 is an alternative to the i5-7600k that is much cheaper.

I've got it to go to 4.8GHz at 1.45V.* It now gets a slightly higher benchmark that a £220 i7.,*(PLEASE do not use this for reference since suitable voltages vary per motherboard, power supply and cooler),It is still one of the best CPU you could get for its price! I used it for about two years. With appropriate cooler you can overclock it substantially. I primarily used it for rendering in Maya, Solidworks and Keyshot. ,Firestrike Physics score:
factory turbo clock enabled avg 4.1GHz - 7200,,manual OC to 4.7GHz - 8400,This Processor is great for overclocking but if you overclock it from 4,2 to 4,8 or 5.0 GHz you need a good cooling solution because it heats very much. ,Great processor, showing a bit in age but can still handle itself well. First PC build ever so I don't have much to complain about.,Love the value. Picked up one of the old sku's without the wraith cooler very cheaply. Overclock went smooth.,Nothing much i can say about it that is not already said else where. Decent CPU. Does what i need it to do. Will prob upgrade sometime in the future to Zen if its worth it.,This thing has been running strong for about 2 years now! It was a great budget/performance for it's time. 
I would not recommend this thing in 2017. There are plenty of new and better processors out there. It still works for me for now but I will be upgrading soon. ,Also if you are looking for high frame rate games (100Hz+) you're going to want something with way higher single-core performance.,I'm comparing this CPU to my old Phenom II X6 1075T which ran at 3.0 Ghz stock - OC to 3.8. So far the performance is only noticeable through benchmarks. ,I like that the FX chips have a higher max core temp at 70C rather than 62C. I like that the multiplier for this processor is unlocked, made OCing quicker and more convenient. I'm an AMD guy so I have nothing bad to say. ,Edit - 01-26-2016 - I'm OC to only 4.4 Ghz. I ran as high as 4.6 with combinations of base + turbo to 4.6, ran 4.5 for a while, and stock of course, but 4.4 is as high as I can get which gives a good temp under load. About 62C max ever seen under benchmark load, but max gaming load is about 55C. ,Edit June 22, 2019 - Just got to 4.5 OC @1.356V. (TEC added back to V10, not on this date but in general.) Temps are very good at max 55C."

I have also overclocked this chip to 5000 mhz although I keep it at 4000 mhz because I do not believe ramping up the voltage gives enough performance for the risk. The single threaded performance is amazing and it destroys anything I have to throw at it.,I bought this for streaming and it has handled it like a champ. Streaming a CPU intensive game like CSGO is no easy task, and this bad boy manages to handle it well. ,Quality build and works great! No problems so far.,I lost the Lotto, I am stable at 4.6.

I was originally going to get the 7700k for it's higher base clock, but decided the 7700 non k was more than enough for my uses. So far when using Lightroom and Photoshop I have noticed the performance increase compared to my old i5 ivy bridge, I had less issues with Cities Skylines too.,It's a solid processor. I'm a bit annoyed in a way that I haven't been able to use it to its full capacity yet. But perfect for emulation- not a single issue there. Good strong single core count. Many threads. If you need strong single cores, but also still need extra threads every now and then, the i7 is still valid. ,There isn't direct competition between amd and Intel. You simply need to decide what you use your processor for and make a decision from there. For each part of what you use it for, there are clear winners.,Really great for those gamers not wanting to delve into overclocking. It works perfectly fine as a gaming CPU and still holds up okay for some slight productivity (though the obvious choice is Ryzen for the more work-related aspects).,Wonderful processor.  I choose this over the K version for the lower power requirements (i.e. 65w vs 95w).  It is plenty powerful and can handle all I throw at it.

Yes, 8700 base freq is 3200, but this setup allow you to stay at I7-8700 built-in OC 4300/4600(1 core) longer and safer. This is done in Intel XTU utility or in BIOS. So, while browsing (balanced Win10 profile): CPU stays under 3000 Mhz, total power use - under 40W, CPU&GPU temps - under 35C. Browsing (CPU and PSU fans in passive mode) - all the same with temps under 45C.,Here is the difference between CPU power profiles in Win10: (5%) idle CPU stays under 2000 MHz, consuming 15W. (100%) idle CPU stays at 4300 Mhz, consuming 20W. Stress Testing: 4300 Mhz (6 cores), total consumption stays under 250W, CPU&GPU temps under 70C. On the other hand, overclocking “K” to 5000Mhz means something like +10% faster and +100% more power consumption, not really efficient.,Also, if your build is really silent, you could start hearing strange very quiet whines. It’s Asrock motherboard’s fault. Just disable CPU C-States in BIOS to stop them. C-States downvolt CPU at idle, but sometimes too awkwardly (voltage will jump and overload motherboard’s capacitors). Win10 does the same job anyway, just without whining. Also, if you disable C7 state only, bad ""whine"" will go, but you'll still be able to hear CPU ""working"". It's kind of cute, like very quiet old IBM System 360.,Very fast CPU - excellent for gaming and multitasking.
Intel 8th generation CPUs give a big performance boost compared to pervious Intel generations.,Works as intended, don't plan to overclock or anything so i got the non K version, plus I'm no programmer or heavy software user. Its enough for my gaming needs and Internet entertainment.,Switching from a i5 4690k to this, I am so happy, especially when I play something like Cities: Skylines, butter smooth.,Excellent CPU, but only if you remember to get a motherboard that allows you to adjust the TDP of the CPU!,At stock settings, it will turbo up to 4.3ghz all core, but then quickly cut timing to stay under the 65w rated TDP. This will lead to very disappointing performance numbers from a CPU of this price.,By going into the motherboard settings of a board with TDP override and manually setting the TDP to 95w or higher, the CPU will turbo up to 4.3ghz and stay there, meaning it will exactly match the performance of a more expensive stock 8700K!,It is really a powerful CPU! It can run up to 4.7GHz. I had trouble to decide between this and AMD CPUs. 1600x with mobo costs me around 280. It will  cost me 70 more to use 1700, or same price as this if I use 1800x. Given Node202 is such a small case, lower TDP is better. Overall 8700 gives me better performance, lower TDP, stable platform. Plus, I like the mobo has 8 USB ports at rear. I need use a couple of  external HDD, USB drive, wireless keyboard, wireless mouse. 8700k is overpriced at the moment,  without overclocking, there is really no difference to 8700.,Excellent processor for those not looking to overclock. Temps are a nonissue.,I knew that I wouldn't have much interest in overclocking but I still wanted a hyperthreaded Coffee Lake processor which left me with only one real choice. The 8700 is basically an 8700K at stock settings except my cores only reach 4.6 GHz as opposed to 4.7 GHz on the 8700K. Installation was super easy and it has absolutely met my expectations so far. ,My only recommendation for anyone interested in this chip is to buy an aftermarket cooler! Even though its locked, the turbo frequencies can still warm things up quite a bit and the stock cooler is pretty ugly!,Got it for 300$ at my (far away) local Frys Electronics. No problems so far, does everything I need it to at a reasonable speed. 6 Cores is nice and the 4.6 turbo boost helps quite a bit as a non-overclocker."

Great for streaming good looking games.,Coming from an i5-4570, I was deciding whether to get an i5 every 2-3 years or simply an i7 and hopefully use it for 4-5 years.

It will handle easily every office task you will trow at it and, when paired with a good set of ram, it will even handle some light gaming. If you are not planning on overclocking, the provided air cooler should be enough. One thing to notice is that the cooler fan shroud (the one with the AMD logo, which is a separate part from the fan) will hit the ram once installed; to solve this problem you can simply remove the fan plastic shroud or you could unscrew the fan and rotate it by 90 degrees, which is what i have done.,I'm still not super tech savvy to the degree as most other people, but the Radeon graphics were good for light games and the CPU handles semi-intense multitasking very well.  ,Stock cooler seems good for non-OC use.,Working as intended so far, it has integrated graphics which is nice to have. Really good price for a solid cpu."

Went for this solely for the exceptional price and I'd never use integrated graphics anyways so I was glad to save some money and lose a feature I'd never use.,I highly suggest using an aftermarket cooler to utilize the full potential of this bang for your buck CPU. I would argue this is one of the best values on the market at this time.,Great price and value for an i5 thanks to the lack of integrated graphics (so a separate GPU is required). The bundled fan has been sufficient for me so far. The fan has a plastic wire hook on one side which sticks out ever so slightly so make sure to orient it so it's not in the way of anything on small motherboards.,If you don't plan on overclocking and want an Intel build, this will do a great job.

Yes, Intel chips run faster, but this is a less expensive locomotive compared to most chips.,The wraith sprire that came with this was more than adequate for stock speeds.  While very attractive with it's LED ring and AMD logo it had an odd frequency of noise at moderate load.  ,So can you OC with the stock spire cooler?  Yes, but... it depends.  The Tomahawk board has a game mode where the fans rev up and push the 2700 chip to 3.65 GHz (from 3.2Ghz) and it runs a bit hot for my liking.  If you go further than that, the cooler's limit is hit and you'll be in the mid to high 80s real quick under load.  The 3.8 Ghz stable OC with auto voltage I have on the system now worked for about 5 seconds of benchmarking on the stock cooler before locking up.,I realize the silicon lottery has a say in this, but if you're planning to OC, I would suggest getting an aftermarket cooler.,Works good.

As with my 3600 the 3800x works best basically running stock. With my cooling I have boost clocks up to 4550mhz and all core of around 4200mhz. Tide temperatures never exceed 82C and CPU 70C. Idles around 40C Tdie and low 30's CPU. No complaints with this processor.,I initially intended to get the 3900X, however I couldn’t find it in stock anywhere and in all honesty, it was probably overkill for my needs.

It performs as expected and boosts without any problem while keeping below 75 degrees with my Noctua D-15 air cooler.,With basic PBO enabled all cores are hitting between 4,475 to 4,525 Ghz.

The difference in price was only 1000 Rupees (14 USD). So I thought why not, and bought the Ryzen 3800x instead.,Absolutely amazing. It's literally knocking my socks off right now. I wish I could have ordered one without the cooler since I'm using the AIO. It's just another box of size for me to keep around.,Using the 3800X in my music production PC with no complaints. Not overclocking and it is very stable.,No problems, two free games, and hopefully this will be future proofed for a while.,Great CPU, however if it does not go on sale it is better for you to buy the 3700x.,Processes things, gets a solid 1.9k in cinebench r15"

Micro Center had this for $79.99 which is the cheapest price I could find.,Use these bad boys a lot, it has 4 cores, decent clock speeds, integrated graphics that put Intel's to shame and a decent stock cooler for around $100. It is the to go 4 core ryzen chip for me,,Intrigued by the first generation of Ryzen processors, I decided to look into the 2nd generation based on performance benchmarks I've seen with integrated graphics. This is the little CPU/APU that could. Whether I'm streaming HD videos, running multiple programs, playing games, or all the above, this little guy definitely performed well. Considering the $70 price difference between this 2200G and the Ryzen 5 2400G, its performance was actually relative to the latter CPU. For that difference in price, I'd recommend this CPU over the 2400G.,Note that the Vega 8 Graphics will take up 0.3GB of RAM. This also means running dual channel will optimize performance, though this ran just fine even on single channel memory.,This also pairs wonderfully with the RX 560. Sure, the card could use a bit more CPU performance, but the bottleneck isn't as severe as with higher-end cards. This pairing is perfect for budget builds.,This is the main reason I made this project. A cheap and low power processor with a capable iGPU that can make wonders for its price. Hope AMD keep this nice APU lineup.,For the price, it is an exceptional budget chip. Seeing how it pretty much out performs the R3 lineup completely, and even performs on par with the R5 1400, I'd say this is one of the best chips that you can currently get if you're going for a budget build.
I got mine clocked to 3.95 Ghz, and it runs like a beast. I love this thing.,Solid quad core APU can play a lot games on decent settings quite well ,Came as a combo set with the Gigabyte AB350M-DS3H. I honestly bought this set on a whim because the voice in my head told me that combo = deals (YMMV). It's a decent enough APU - had the chance to test out the integrated graphics before my 1050 Ti came in. It ran most of my games fairly well, save for a few spikes in performance. However, the fact of the matter is that it does its job well. For those looking for perhaps low-end retro or older generation gaming, this chip should do the trick."

My chip can handle 5GHz nicely and I've definitely enjoyed it so far.,Amazing performance. 8 cores and 8 threads make it best suited to pure gaming.,For high frame rate 1440p and (some 4k) gaming it pretty much came down to this or the 9900k, Since I will be gaming more than anything else the performance gains of the 9900k wasn't worth the extra cost. So far I haven't been even remotely disappointed, it should be able hold its own for the next 5+ years no problem.,Not much to say here.  It's an Intel i7.  I hope to OC it at some point, but haven't as of yet.  I didn't enjoy my one experience with the original AMD Athlon, so I've stuck with Intel since.  I've never used an after market cooler before, so installing the Dark Rock will be a new experience for me.,Awesome processor, great overclocked or stock."

My first arrived DOA, it was replaced with minimal fuss and has worked well without slowing down for a few years now. It doesn't boot up in very cold ambient conditions, though.,Great entry-level SSD. I've heard good things about Mushkin and the Chronos series is definitely a good choice if you can find them under $50 (even more competitively priced would be ~$40) and you don't want to sit and nitpick about read/write speeds, you just want an SSD in the system for your OS and essentials.,I got this SSD for free from my friend it works nice and fast. I had to look up a tutorial to install windows on it because I was having a little bit of problems at first otherwise it's fine.,Works just fine for me, computer boots very quickly. Looking back I wish I'd gone with a larger SSD, because this tends to get filled up very quickly."

This product is not that; it is a commodity Sata-limited design.  But I hope the company has applied its engineering and quality skills here too.,In the low-price SSD market, I avoid OCZ, ADATA, and companies that were unknown 2 years ago.  OCZ was once a premium brand in the RAM market, but nuked itself with a series of disastrously bad SSD products.  Its brand got acquired by a different company, but I don't know if their new products are reliable.,I initially planned to augment the SSD with a 1TB 2.5"" hard drive, but then decided to not bother; 60GB total capacity is fine for now.,60GB was adequate for installing Windows 7 plus upgrades to SP1 (and next to Windows 10).   I initially tried using just a 30GB partition, but that was not enough to support the huge patch-update downloads to get from Win7 to Win7 SP1.  So 40-60GB may be the lowest practical size for the primary disk for Windows."

I have a lot of videos and music edits I do for YouTube and side-jobs! Really awesome job!!!,Some complaints here. 128MB cache makes it very fast but this drive is NOT quiet. Kind of grindy, actually, which is not a good descriptive word for a hard drive. I've read this is relatively normal for this drive and it's otherwise performed very well over the last year I've had it. Great price per TB for fast HDD storage. Just not for quiet builds. I use this as a backup drive, however, and as long as I leave the power saving options for my HDDs at ""only spin up on demand,"" this one only makes its noises after I've gone to bed. In another room.,Got them for mirroring and mass storage. Working great for the last year,Lots of space, for a relatively low price. What more do you need? It is a bit loud when reading/writing though.,I bought the 5TB earlier this year due to getting a Humble subscription and running out of space. It holds a wealth of video games and old files. I like the nostalgic HDD noises it makes when spinning up. It reminds me of good times. If you're looking for a quiet drive, this is not it. The Big T will carry any files you need it to, but stealth is not an option.,I'm a big fan of WD, so going with Toshiba was a tough decision to make. But when you compare the specs and what you're paying for them, it was an easy decision in the end. 
It's worked great with my system so far. ,I had two 1TB drives before I got this and ran out of space. Was originally going to go with a WD Black 4TB but after I read up more this drive actually has had less failures in tests and for 5TB is a great price.,Got it almost on a whim when my storage was running low. This postponed the addressing of my video game hoarding problems and allowed me to collect them all year long. It's a massive drive, but I do intend to fill it before getting something bigger in the same fashion I bought this one. I'm hoping 10TB is readily available when it's finally time for me to upgrade my 1TB that sits beside this one. Got it on sale, but I forget the price. Needless to say it didn't really matter all that much as I needed something like this regardless of what I was paying in order to continue my lifestyle choices.

However the noise is a little unbearable. Not ideal for silent seekers.,To store all the data, I have two RAID 0 arrays setup with the 4x4TB drives (added in Aug, 2014). The main array is hardware striped for performance, the backup is software spanned. Although, RAID 10 is easier to setup, its advantage of lower array failure require six or more disks. I have decreased energy use and decreased latency due to less disks having to spin up on access. I spanned the 2nd array for two reasons; performance is not as important, and a spanned array has a better chance for data recovery in the event of a failure. At the time, there was a good deal on these drives on Newegg, and I did manage to get these from two different batches (by luck).,Red series is not only for NAS, I chose it as my main storage disk in this build because it's fast and quiet. Don't be duped by 5400 RPM, it's actually faster than most 7200 RPM disks (at least which I used before). This is also related to the size of the disk, for example a 4GB disk is faster than a 1GB disk. I had Black series in the past but damn that thing was noisy. So this thing is sufficient for gaming from my experience (no need to trash SSDs), the games I tried loaded fast (or normal). I usually trust Western Digital disks, they never disappoint me.,As a lone drive, it's great but there are less expensive options out there, but for anyone wishing to build a NAS (as they have been designed for) these are good drives. They run cool and quiet, and I haven't had any operating problems with it for the last thirteen months . I've always used Western Digital hard drives in my systems, and this is another reason why.,This was my original media drive before I got a Synology DS1815+ NAS.  I couldn't use it in the NAS b/c it was the drive I was transferring stuff from, and I had set the NAS up w/ 6TB drives and SHR, so you can't install < 6TB drives later.  It sat around for a few months until I built this machine, and now it's a great place for steam games to live.,A no brainer when coming to a system that will operate 24/7.  The WD Reds are reliable and will last many years.  ,Besides the colour, I was not expecting much difference between the WD Red and Green, however, I've noticed that this Red one runs a bit quieter than its Green counterpart (they both run at 5400RPM)."

I'm able to have all my storage in a single, speedy unit. Very convenient, and noticeably fast for booting up, copying files, video editing, music production (e.g. loading large sample libraries). This SSD is super fast.,As a quick tip, if you're migrating from one SSD to a larger one like I did, I used Macrium Reflect free software to make a clone of my 1TB SSD.  It creates a single large file that has the entire image of your SSD. Then, I copy that cloned image onto a USB hard drive I had. Then, I loaded Macrium Reflect onto a bootable USB stick. (they make it easy to create a Macrium Reflect bootable USB stick). Turn off your computer, replace your old SSD with your new, larger SSD, insert the USB stick, boot up your computer and boot off the USB stick so that Macrium Reflect starts up, and then you can have Macrium Reflect use the CLONE image from the hard drive and restore that image onto your new SSD. ,Then, when you remove the hard drive and USB stick and boot up (at least in Windows), you'll notice your PC still only shows you have 1TB. Go into disk manager in Windows, and you'll see a huge unallocated partition. If you right click your current partition (the one that has your operating system on it), you can ""EXTEND"" it to take up all the room from the unallocated partition. ,And just like that, you have more space on your PC! While the actual steps don't take much time (maybe 30-60 minutes of your time), the creation and copying of the image can take several hours, so maybe do it overnight or when you don't need the PC for some hours.,Yeah, I know NVME vs SSD doesn't make much difference.

But I figured I'd make this initial investment now, since upgrading that stick (Which is located on the bottom side of the motherboard) will be a ridiculous pain in the butt once I've started using it properly.

In hindsight, I wish  I got a 250 GB drive.,Alot of my friends steered clear of Sandisk, but I gave them a shot. Used as a boot drive, I'm surprised by it's boot speed and I've had zero problems so far.,good bang for the buck. only have the OS on it so i cant really say much other than it boots quickly,Is great for the price, it has fast read speeds but not very fast write speeds, I only needed a cheap SSD with fast read speeds for my operating system and this was a good choice I think.,Insanely budget friendly and fast SSD, couldn't be happier with it.  I boot insanely fast, definitely recommend."

If you have a few more bucks/Euros, I recommend a Samsung or HyperX instead of this.,I've used only SSDs on my computers for the last 5 years and I simply cannot go back to legacy HDDs. This was the cheapest SSD I found at the time. Although 240GB might not seem like much, the speed trade off is worth it for me. Windows boots in a few seconds and any application loads instantly.,It's very fast for what I need and it's cheap.,Very fast and great value. Boot times are impeccable ,I always use these A-Data drives in budget systems. Can't go wrong. Have yet to have any problems with them.,Can't ever go back to HDD for OS, and this is plenty fast for plenty cheap too!,A SSD for the system is a must. The cheap cost and superiour boot speeds and stability make it a simple choice. Mechanical drives are too big and slow... M.2 and PCI-E memory is too expensive and not worth the additional seconds off the boot time or the additional Motherboard cost for a model that supports it.,A 240GB SSD is more cost effective than a 120GB, but jumping to a 480 from 240 still doubles the price. ,For maximum value, I would consider running 2X 240GB SSD in RAID 0 for the performance boost for basically the same cost as a single 480 GB. (I intend to make this upgrade next.),The variance in performance of SSD does not justify the price variations. GET THE CHEAPEST ONE YOU CAN FIND.,As it stands, the single SSD allows me to boot into a desktop from hitting the power button in 19 seconds (Win 7, WITHOUT quick-boot),NOTE:  I am eager to quantify the increase in boot speed once I go RAID 0 after adding a second 240.  I expect nearly 90% increase in speeds.,Not the quickest SSD but that's fine since my mobo's sata controller is not up to full sata 6 speeds.,There is absolutely nothing interesting about this SSD, but it's fairly snappy and has worked great for 4+ years.,Loads up Windows in seconds.

However, I saw this unit and it had similar specs at a cheaper price. The color scheme of this unit matched my build better than the Samsung so i thought i would give it a try. No issues so far.,By far the best $140 I spent. My system boots up in less than 10 seconds. I love it. The drive looks nice in black/red.,Windows 10 boots in less than 5 seconds.,Got it for a very good price and couldn't say NO. Eventhough i planned to install a 850 Pro i gave PNY a try. Lets see how it will work out for me. Barely found any reviews about this drive.,This price point was a little high compared to similar SSDs, but the styling matches my particular case well. I'm enjoying my fast boot time! 5/5,This SSD was only $109.99 when I bought it, which is a kick-*** deal. But over time, boot times worsened. When I ran a CrystalDiskMark benchmark with a 16GB sample, I found the 4K IOPS performance to fall to 106 MB/s random reads, and 105 MB/s random write. I don't know if this is normal for SSD's, especially the Samsung drives, but this is pathetic in my mind. But it's got 480GB of storage which I use to hold all of my commonly-used programs and my Windows 10 Pro on here.,UPDATE: After looking at the sequentials, for a 16GB-sized sample, the performance blows, so I docked another star from the overall rating. The advertised sequential write is 520 MB/s.,Great SSD for a great price. That being said, when I bought the SSD, it was $108. ,My boot from my 2015 PC. The first PC I built at home. The SSD is a little newer than the old build, and now it lives in my newest build holding video games. Still kicking on all four cylinders, it's not top of the line but it gets the job done.,Fantastic at least as far as clean installs go. Put one in my old laptop a few months ago worked like a charm and dramatically improved performance.

Fast storage, great for a boot/programs drive, cheap,Cons:
Not as fast as some other SSDs,It's not a fast SSD, but it works for just $30. Get a Zotac Premium or even a 850 evo instead,Lasted 2 years, and was dang quick for 2 years. Windows wouldn't finish spinning before it would load the OS! But, it randomly crapped out fairly recently while transferring some files out of Dropbox. 
RIP 1st SSD, you will be missed, we won't forget you, amen,The reason I gave it 3 stars is Toshiba/OCZ sent me a replacement with 2 day shipping very quickly. (Although it was the TL100, which is pretty bad for files >1gb. Stuck it in my server instead, as it deals with savefiles that are only a couple kb)

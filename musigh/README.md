# Musigh Spider
This is a spider for the website: [http://www.musigh.com](Musigh.com)
The website look like its about to stop being useable soon so I decided to save the songs he shared with us to a S3 bucket.

The main spider is the *MusighSpider* which will scrape all the audio that were shared as .mp3 (not the soundcloud ones)

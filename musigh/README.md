# Musigh Spider
This is a spider for the website: [Musigh.com](http://www.musigh.com)
The website look like its about to stop being useable soon so I decided to save the songs he shared with us to a S3 bucket.

The main spider is the *MusighSpider* which will scrape all the audio that were shared as .mp3 (not the soundcloud ones)

In total I was able to scrape out **855** mp3 which amount ot about 6.5GB of music.
